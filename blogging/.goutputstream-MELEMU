<h4>October 2008 research progress report</h4>

<h5>Summary of activities:</h5>

<p>Many hours were spent in attending Linear Algebra,
Computational Learning Theory and Randomized Algorithms class. Many
hours were spent in Linear Algebra studies and assignments. Some hours
were spent in Computational Learning Theory studies and assignments.
Some hours were spent in Randomized algorithms, algebra, computational
complexity theory and probability studies.</p>

<p>There were two research meetings, the latter of which was
fairly successful. Some hours were spent on research reading, mainly
about Game theory and learning in repeated games: regret minimization.</p>

<p>Many hours were spent in TA duty.</p>

<h5>Evaluation of the month:</h5>

<p>Weakness in prioritization and planning observed. This must be
corrected.</p>

<p>There were two research meeting cancellations in a row. This
is ill done. More time must be spent on research.</p>

<p>Not benefitting from the Computational Learning Theory reading
group meeting due to lack of time. Research interaction skills must be
improved.</p>

<p>Yoga practice started; resulting in better strength and
flexibility.</p>

<h5>Plans for the next month:</h5>

<p>Good prioritization is essential in planning activities.
Execution skills must be improved; perhaps with the use of preparatory
rituals and verses to remove congintive dissonance.</p>

<p>Linear algebra, being a diversity course, is important. For
good performance, performance in&nbsp;the midterm and the final
exams should be good.</p>

<p>Backlog of ideas to be considered and recorded should be
quickly cleared.</p>

<p>TA duty is expected to be more demanding, due to the need to
grade proofs, and to read about Hoare logic.</p>

<p>The learning theory professor seems to be sharp and kind.
Progress in game theory and computational learning theory studies must
be strengthened, in order to suitably impress the Professor.</p>

<p>Must gather information, advice about research and researchers
from the learned guest.</p>
