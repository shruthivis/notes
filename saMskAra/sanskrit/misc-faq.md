- Samskrit OR Samkritam OR Sanskrit OR Sanskrut?
    - Depends on how you say the sa, the m and the r in संस्कृतम्।, rather than how you write really (since it is impossible to losslessly encode the highly specific devanAgarI sounds in the very limited latin alphabet without adapting clear conventions such as [these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari_transliteration)). To appreciate the difference, you should understand the difference between the way म् and ं sounds (the latter does not include a reverberation in the mouth cavity); and between ऋ and रि/ रु.
