    <p>Advice obtained through Chinmayi.</p>
    <p>The following are Chinmayi's impressions about working with
    Prof. Dhillon, based on conversations with Prateek Jain, who is
    a very successful student graduating in December and starting
    work in MSR India.</p>
    <p>It is not a good idea to trust Prof. Dhillon for ideas and
    project guidance. You must take initiative and be independent.
    He may not be very good at supplying problems or deriving
    solutions actively. Even if he shoots it down, you should not
    leave a promising idea, but fully develop it and turn it into a
    research paper on your own initiative; then he will be happy
    and support publication. Prateek, through contact with the
    highly independent Suvrit Sra, learnt to be independent.</p>
