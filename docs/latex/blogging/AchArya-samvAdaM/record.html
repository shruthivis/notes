    <h2><a id="x1-1000I"></a>Things done since last report</h2>
    <p>Presented the affiliation networks paper to others,
    solicited ideas. But more promising social-nework research
    topics have emerged apart from graph generation.</p>
    <p>I have been reading papers related to these problems,
    acquired some data-sets, and making further plans for
    experimentation and pursuing these ideas. Read these papers:
    ’Co-clustering documents and words using bipartitite spectral
    graph partitioning: Dhillon’ and ’Clustering social networks:
    Trajan et al’. In one case, failed to get un-anonymized orkut
    data from authors.</p>
    <h4><a id="x1-20001"></a>Summary of research activities so
    far</h4>
    <p>Main activities have been: I studied the various temporal/
    static, macro/ micro-scopic properties of network evolution.
    Then, I read about various network evolution models, their
    merits and demerits. Affilitation networks seem to be
    attracting much attention lately. From this context, it seems
    best to divert research towards exploring them (eg:
    co-clustering them) and their use in solving various problems
    in social network analysis (eg: in link prediction).</p>
    <h2><a id="x1-3000II"></a>Ideas and questions</h2>
    <h4><a id="x1-40002"></a>vartamAna-somshodhanAni</h4>
    <h5><a id="x1-50002.1"></a>Link prediction</h5>
    <p>Use microscopic evolution model here; or observe link
    formation statistics (degree distribution of new linkers etc..)
    and try to replicate these statistics while making
    predictions.</p>

    <h6><a id="x1-60002.1.1"></a>Using affiliation networks</h6>
    <p>See if affiliation nw can be used to predict links. Maybe
    bias assigned to affiliation nw observations can be learned
    from using the corresponding social-nw evolution data.</p>

    <h6><a id="x1-70002.1.2"></a>Experiments</h6>
    <p>Acquire data for evolving social networks, with
    corresponding affiliation networks. Perhaps Yin Zhang’s
    students are trawling various social networking websites.</p>
    <h5><a id="x1-80002.2"></a>Partitioning/ clustering bi-partite
    graphs</h5>
    <p>Extend current graph partitioning algorithms to have soft
    clusters.</p>
    <p>Try extending clustering algorithms by Brian and Trajan to
    co-cluster bi-partitite graphs.</p>

    networks</h5>
    <p>credits: pratIka.</p>
    <h6><a id="x1-100002.3.1"></a>Ideas</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Use special properties of these networks to improve
      clustering.</li>
      <li>Try to use information from corresponding social network
      to better cocluster the affiliation nw.</li>
    </ul>
    <h6><a id="x1-110002.3.2"></a>Actions</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Acquire affilation network data to experiment with: ones
      with community names.</li>
      <li>Consider previous work on co-clustering bipartite
      graphs.</li>
      <li>Consider previous work on clustering social networks in
      general. May give you ideas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h6><a id="x1-120002.3.3"></a>Experiments</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Try implementing the simple dhillon alg.</li>
      <li>Try applying the Trajan algorithm.</li>
      <li>Try the algorithm where ye cluster users and clusters by
      iteratively folding the affiliation nw to get user nw/
      community nw and then using clusters in one nw to cluster the
      other nw.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><a id="x1-130002.4"></a>Clustering nodes in social
    networks</h5>
    <p>Cluster nodes in social networks. Use special properties of
    these networks to improve clustering. Try to use affiliation nw
    here.</p>

    <h4><a id="x1-140003"></a>Deferred research projects</h4>
    <p>Construct a graph generative model which, besides having
    good static and temporal properties displayed by graphs evolved
    using other models, also shows hierarchical community
    structure.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you extend the affiliation networks model to do
      this?</li>
      <li>This can be done if the idea to use affiliation networks
      algorithm to generate clusters and then interconnect them
      works.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given the k*k q(xhat, yhat) matrix, which specifies the edge
    densities between various node clusters, make a generative
    model which produces graphs with that clustering structure,
    such that it possesses various static and temporal properties
    of real world graphs.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A trivial solution exists if the diagonal entries heavily
      dominate others. Is this well motivated?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consider the problem of learning a decision tree with a 1/n
    correlated parity, given a noisy parity learner which only
    works with constant noise.</p>
    <h2><a id="x1-15000III"></a>Suggested Plans</h2>
    <h4><a id="x1-160004"></a>Administrativia</h4>
    <p>Take research course with Prof. Dhillon in fall.</p>
    <h4><a id="x1-170005"></a>Research</h4>
    <p>Pursue ideas and experimentation related to the use of
    affiliation networks in link prediction, and to the problem of
    co-clustering affiliation networks.</p>
    <h5><a id="x1-180005.1"></a>Data acquisition</h5>
    <p>Current data we have lacks group names: this makes it hard
    to evaluate clustering. Trying to get data with group
    names.</p>
    <p>Get data for evolving social networks’ snapshots with
    corresponding affiliation networks.</p>
    <h4><a id="x1-190006"></a>Feedback</h4>
    <p>Indrajita-AchArya mentioned a few papers which presented
    work related to co-clustering affiliation networks.</p>
    <p>He acquiesced to our current lines of research in exploring
    link prediction and in co-clustering affiliation networks. He
    suggested that this can be my course-project, but in the
    meantime I must implement my ideas regarding generation of
    graphs with a particular cluster structure.</p>
    <p>I was reprimanded for not implementing the above algorithm.
    My concern that there was insufficient motivation/ merit in
    executing this work was dismissed. My objection to the
    expectation for my implementing the algorithm on the grounds
    that it was not initially clear that I was to implement this
    was also dismissed.</p>
    <p>The research course form was signed.</p>
    <h2><a id="x1-20000IV"></a>Lessons and plan ahead</h2>
    <h4><a id="x1-210007"></a>Criticism of the exchange</h4>
    <p>The professor, in insisting on my implementing the graph
    generation algorithm rather than immediately start work on the
    proposed new projects, and in doing so sternly, is clearly
    asserting his power over me.</p>
    <p>I was nervous. I was unable to understand details in a
    certain technical conversation. This lapse was recognized.</p>
    <p>Nervousness also prevented me from presenting the graph
    generation algorithm properly. I later wrote it out and showed
    it, after attempting analysis with pratIka.</p>
    <p>During a later conversation, my lack of critical thinking
    was observed. I was unable to recall the shortcomings of the
    Kronecker product model and the microscopic network evolution
    model. On later thought, the latter is not ameanable to
    mathematical analysis, while the former does not grow one node
    at a time.</p>
    <p>Nervousness should have been overcome by solemnly
    recognizing that exchange of information/ expectations is the
    most important point of the meeting and determinedly focusing
    the intellect on it.</p>
    <h4><a id="x1-220008"></a>Action required</h4>
    <p>Alter communication strategy to eliminate nervousness in
    future meetings.</p>
    <p>Promptly and quickly implement the algorithm and focus on
    important research.</p>
    <p>Update new information about the professor in advisor
    hunt.</p>
