<h1 id="organizations">Organizations</h1>

<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>

<p>Some organizations are focused on earning money for their owners by pursuing and growing a certain business.</p>

<p>Charitable organizations are focused on gathering resources (usually from donations) and spending them to promote social good by a ceratin type of activity. They are usually managed by a board of trustees.</p>

<h1 id="businesses-general-mechanism">Businesses: general mechanism</h1>

<h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>

<p>At any given point in time, it is clear from documentation/ declaration who the owners of a business are, what portion of the business they own.</p>

<p>Owners usually get a portion of profit as ’dividends’. They have a say in appointing the highest level/ board of executives/ managers who run the company on their behalf.</p>

<h3 id="shares-equity">Shares/ Equity</h3>

<h4 id="public-offerings">Public offerings</h4>

<p>Existing owners or executives can effectively divide the company’s ownership into a certain number of shares. A common way of expanding the ownership of a company is to sell these shares to the general public at a price which is either preset or determined automatically by an auction. This process is called the initial public offering/ IPO.</p>

<h4 id="dividing-profit">Dividing profit</h4>

<p>Companies offer a dividend to owners by proportionally dividing the annual profits. This makes ownership of the company attractive, which becomes useful when the owners decide to sell more shares to raise more money.</p>

<p>High dividend yield companies offer a big dividend relative to the share value - they thus constitute attractive investment.</p>

<h4 id="market-capitalization">Market capitalization</h4>

<p>A rough way to calculate the value of a company is to measure it by multiplying the number of shares by their market price. Depending on the size of the market capitalization, companies are classified into small, medium and large capital (cap) companies.</p>

<h4 id="privileges">Privileges</h4>

<p>Shares grant varying privileges: voting rights, priority in receiving payment in the event of liquidation of assets after bankruptcy.</p>

<h3 id="succession">Succession</h3>

<p>In many firms, a small group of people - eg: a family - owns a large fraction of the shares. Oftentimes, it was one of them (or their ancestor) who started the business, and one or more of them are actively running it.</p>

<h4 id="professional-management">Professional management</h4>

<p>Sometimes the owners appoint professional managers/ CEO’s to run the company. Sometimes, they pick managers from their family. This is more common in countries where social contracts are weakly enforced, so trust outside the family is low.</p>

<h4 id="nepotism">Nepotism</h4>

<p>Statistics reveal that succession involving nepotism in general results in poorer performance. This is often because the person given the responsibility of running the enterprise is not as capable of running a business as their predecessors - either due to lack of talent or due to lack of energy and drive to work hard. Also focusing on one’s family artificially removes access to top talent outside the family.</p>

<p>Japanese firms often rely on adoption to solve this problem.</p>

<h2 id="starting-and-funding-business">Starting and funding business</h2>

<p>Entrepreneurship.</p>

<h3 id="funding-business">Funding business</h3>

<p>The effect of governments on business operations and running is described elsewhere.</p>

<h4 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h4>

<p>People with a good business idea may get ’seed money’ from an ’angel investor’ to make a prototype. The angel investors may well be governments or university funds.</p>

<h4 id="launch">Launch</h4>

<p>Then, they pitch it to venture capitalists who provide two rounds of funding in return for a share in the company.</p>

<h4 id="expansion">Expansion</h4>

<p>A third round of funding, called the mezzannine funding, is then sought for a possible expansion phase, usually after the company is profitable.</p>

<p>Later, the companies often get money from the general public at large, through stock market, in return for a share in the company’s ownership, as necessary.</p>

<h4 id="long-term-borrowing">Long-term Borrowing</h4>

<p>This is often done by issuing bonds at the stock exchange or taking regular loans.</p>

<h4 id="short-term-borrowing">Short-term borrowing</h4>

<p>For day-to-day operations, businesses may need money, but they may not hold any reserve capital for that purpose - all of it may be invested in expansion.</p>

<p>So, depending on the day-to-day financial situation companies<br />
borrow money from the ’commercial paper market’, where various entities (especially money market mutual funds) lend money over the short-term. Commercial paper is essentially notes acknowledging these short-term, usually safe loans.</p>

<h4 id="leverage">Leverage</h4>

<p>Sometimes entities are allowed to be liable for much more money than they are worth. This is especially true in dealing with stocks and bonds, where people can make especially risky maneuvers to get high returns: entities are allowed to buy stocks with the agents money, insurances involved in credit-swap make huge guarantees.</p>

<h2 id="bankruptcy">Bankruptcy</h2>

<p>When a company declares bankruptcy, it says that it is incapable of meeting all of its financial commitments/ liabilities. All of its agreements with trade-unions are then also canceled.</p>

<p>The business’s assets can be liquidated (seized, valued and sold) to satisfy its liabilities. Also, the company may be taken over and restructured; and the new owner can repay outstanding debts.</p>

<h3 id="rescue">Rescue</h3>

<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>

<p>The government is often motivated to rescue failing businesses to prevent negative consequences like job loss, reduction in national pride etc..</p>

<p>’Distress investors’ are motivated by the prospects of taking ownership of a well established enterprise cheaply, if they believe they can make it profitable.</p>

<h4 id="overpaying-for-bad-assets">Overpaying for bad assets</h4>

<p>One way rescue can happen is by buying or by encouraging others in buying toxic assets/ investments of the business at a sufficiently high price to ensure that the company regains solvency - the drawback is that the investor (tax-payer/ government usually) is then stuck with an unsound investment.</p>

<h4 id="stock-injection">Stock injection</h4>

<p>Another way is to invest in the business - become one of its owners by replenishing the business’s capital.</p>

<p>As part of doing so, it is often essential to ensure that future investments are sounder, so the management is often to be replaced or stress tests are conducted, where businesses are allowed to fail if they fail to perform even after a rescue.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h4>

<p>Businesses which are rescued from collapse as a consequence of mistakes tend to make more bad moves in the future - especially if the management is not replaced. This happened with Japanese banks in 1990’s.</p>

<h1 id="labor">Labor</h1>

<h2 id="hiring-in-businesses">Hiring in businesses</h2>

<p>Academic hiring follows a different pattern.</p>

<h3 id="selectivity">Selectivity</h3>

<p>Hiring people is generally easier than getting rid of them. So, when possible, businesses create interview processes which have low ’false positive’ rates - even at the cost of high ’false negative’ rates.</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p>Often, specialized recruiters are used to make initial contacts with people - in order to get an idea of where how the candidate may fit the company’s needs. That person then may pitch the candidate to potential hirers.</p>

<h4 id="screening-rounds">Screening rounds</h4>

<p>There is often a written/ programming/ modeling test or a technical phone screen, and successful candidates are then invited for an in-person interviews (travel expenses usually being paid by the hirer).</p>

<h4 id="technical-interviews">Technical interviews</h4>

<p>In each of these stages, multiple persons (including potential hiring managers and peers) are used to reduce margin of error. In interviews, potential employers probe the candidate’s knowledge, skills and personality. Ideally, interviewers should allow the candidate some time to think, try to minimize pressure - especially if ’working under pressure’ is not a job requirement.</p>

<h4 id="big-boss-interview">Big-boss interview</h4>

<p>The final interview is usually with the highest-level boss, where a simple technical question may be asked. The reason for this final interview is unclear - except perhaps the company wanting to rely on the ’feeling’ of a senior person.</p>

<p>Research seems to show that in such qualitative interviews’ outcomes are decided in the first few moments of the interview!</p>

<h3 id="candidates-strategy">Candidate’s strategy</h3>

<p>The candidate’s strategy is to present his skills, knowledge and professional attitude to the interviewers; and to gather information/ impressions to judge whether the organization - especially the team he will be working with - will match his expectations.</p>

<h4 id="attitude">Attitude</h4>

<p>The professional attitude to be presented includes calmness, the ability to collect and compose oneself and one’s proposals. A social aspect is being friendly, with pleasant body language described elsewhere.</p>

<h4 id="answers-and-limits">Answers and limits</h4>

<p>When his knowledge and skills are being probed in live-communication, the candidate should answer to the best of his ability - taking time to think if necessary. He may not be able to answer all questions - especially if he is seeking work which is at the edge of his abilities.</p>

<h4 id="judging-potential-employers">Judging potential employers</h4>

<p>This is done both by reading online reviews (Eg: glassdoor.com ), by asking questions to potential peers/ managers, and by observing their interactions with you and each other.</p>

<h4 id="salary-negotiation">Salary negotiation</h4>

<p>Know how much you can get both for the job in a particular area in general and from the company in particular, by visiting online surveys (eg: glassdoor.com ). Use this to answer questions about the ’expected salary’.</p>

<h2 id="motivation-1">Motivation</h2>

<p>Motivating a hired employee to do his job involves ensuring that his pleasure/ satisfaction (perhaps even pain) coincides with benefits and loss of the company.</p>

<p>The best case is when the employee, by nature, cares deeply about doing his job well - which is why good hiring is important.</p>

<p>Another alternative is to do this using rewards and threats. Research shows that for menial/ mechanical tasks, this works; but for creative work, this approach is counter-productive.</p>

<h2 id="variation-parameters">Variation parameters</h2>

<h3 id="employment-term">Employment term</h3>

<p>Employment may be short term or long term. Laws usually guarantee minimum daily wages.</p>

<h3 id="mobility">Mobility</h3>

<p>Contracts or laws may limit a worker’s mobility.</p>

<p>Indentured laborers have agreed to serve for a certain period of time under certain conditions in exchange for money/ transportation paid in advance.</p>

<p>In case of slavery, the laborer is considered the property of the owner/ employer; and employment changes only when the slave is sold.</p>

<h3 id="working-conditions">Working conditions</h3>

<p>Some countries, by law limit working hours (36 hours in France, t be compensated when violated), specify minimum vacation (5 weeks in France, often exceeded), unlimited paid sick-leave (heavily subsidized by government in France), maternity/ fraternity leave (with maid service in France), heavily subsidized day-care.</p>

<p>Other countries, such as USA; and certain industries, are more friendly towards employers rather than employees.</p>

<h3 id="remuneration">Remuneration</h3>

<p>Remuneration is paid in various forms: cash, stock options, stock allocation, matching contributions to retirement savings and charities etc..</p>

<h2 id="labor-unions">Labor unions</h2>

<p>Workers collectively have greater bargaining power while negotiating terms of employment (salary, benefits, leave, penalties) with their employer. To this end, they form trade unions.</p>

<h3 id="breakdown-of-negotiations">Breakdown of negotiations</h3>

<p>When negotiations with employers break down, they go on strike - that is halt work without pay, thereby causing loss to the employers. Employers sometimes try to get around the problem by hiring new workers who will accept poorer conditions and work - which often leads to violence and damage, and hence is an unattractive option.</p>

<h3 id="administration-financing-membership">Administration, financing, membership</h3>

<p>Trade unions are usually run by members elected from among the employees. Not every employee is required to be a member of the union or participate in their strikes, but if a union exists and does bargaining on their behalf, even non-members have to pay a bargaining-fee to the union. Trade union elections tend to be very politically charged, and in many cases, they often coerce and punish disagreement and non-membership by illegally means - including arranging undesirable assignments and violence.</p>

<p># <br />
Copyrights, patents and trademarks</p>

<p>Aka intellectual property, a much criticized term because it draws a analogy to physical property which fails in some ways.</p>

<h2 id="patents">Patents</h2>

<p>The purpose of patents is to provide incentives for invention and discovery.</p>

<p>They work in some cases (eg: chemicals and pharmaceuticals) and fail in others (eg: software).</p>
