    <h1 id="usa">USA</h1>

<h2 id="general-economy">General economy</h2>

<p>USA has high trade deficit: especially with oil producing countries and manufacturers like China.</p>

<p>GDP Growth is much lower than in emerging economies: 0-3%.</p>

<h2 id="industry">Industry</h2>

<p>USA’s industry is highly innovative - one of the best in the world. Industries are highly mechanized.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturing">Manufacturing</h3>

<p>America is the biggest manufacturer of goods in the world. But, much of the manufacturing is done in highly automated factories which are run by a handful of skilled employees overseeing the automation; manufacturing involving low skilled labour has moved to countries (in the developing world) with cheaper labor.</p>

<h2 id="public-debt-consumption">Public debt, consumption</h2>

<p>Public debt (not same as government debt) is high (as of 2007-2011): so the consuming power of the population is likely to decrease.</p>

<h3 id="decreasing-income-for-many">Decreasing income for many</h3>

<p>The classic ’American dream’ includes the hope that with each succeeding generation, the standard of living (esp household income) improves. But, household income has actually been decreasing since 1970’s; but the decline was made less noticeable for a few decades due to easily available loans.</p>

<p>For a while, many people masked their declining income using easily granted debt.</p>

<h4 id="low-unskilled-labor-opportunities">Low unskilled labor opportunities</h4>

<p>Historically, there were two ways in which one could attain a good standard of living - by entering the skilled-workforce (mainly in the service industry) after getting good education; and by entering the unskilled factory workforce. The latter option has ended due to the automation and off-shoring in the manufacturing industry. According to several studies, the most promising way of solving this seems to be to offer kindergarten training to ensure that kids acquire sufficient social skills!</p>

<h3 id="high-expenses">High expenses</h3>

<p>Another problem is the rising cost of medical care - the root of which problem probably lies with the fact that employers are incentivized to purchase and offer medical insurance to people.</p>

<h2 id="government-debt">Government debt</h2>

<p>As of 2011, it is at 100% of GDP: Historically, when deficit 90%, nations’ economies tend to decline.</p>

<h3 id="deficit-and-response">Deficit and response</h3>

<p>Tax rate is too low to pay for the local, state and federal government expenditures.</p>

<h4 id="political-deadlock">Political deadlock</h4>

<p>A part of the population, particularly the Republican party supporters, favor a lower level of public service and lower taxation, further they don’t even favor a higher taxation rate for the rich (a response which stems from socialism-phobia and the unrealistic hidden American dream of the non-rich that they will be rich one day).</p>

<p>Another part of the population, supporting the Democratic party, wants higher taxation and maintenance of good government services.</p>

<p>These factions are unable to reach a compromise as of 2011.</p>

<h3 id="lenders">Lenders</h3>

<p>Government debt is high: with many trade-partners (esp: China, Japan) lending back the excess dollars they get due to the trade surplus. For reasons why they do this, consider the case of China described elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="dollar">Dollar</h2>

<p>Much currency is in foreign hands due to USAs’ trade deficit. Also, in response to the credit crisis following the sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007, the Fed devalued the dollar by printing trillions of dollars.</p>

<p>So, dollar is likely to fall in value relative to other currencies, especially Yuan.</p>

<h1 id="japan">Japan</h1>

<p>Since 1990’s the country has been in ’stagflation’, with the economy shrinking in value due to the government allowing banks to make bad loans without repercussions by bailing them out.</p>

<h2 id="deficit">Deficit</h2>

<p>Faced with a declining work-force, strong anti-immigration sentiment and an aging population, government income is projected to decline compared to its expenditures.</p>

<h1 id="europe">Europe</h1>

<h2 id="economic-union">Economic union</h2>

<p>Many countries in Europe are part of a union which allows easy travel and relatively free trade with low taxation. Many are also use a common currency, Euro, issued by a central bank.</p>

<p>A big part of the motivation for doing this was to quell fears that the strong German economy might again give rise to an expansionist war-machine.</p>

<h3 id="euro">Euro</h3>

<p>[<strong>Incomplete</strong>]</p>

<h2 id="strength-of-economies">Strength of economies</h2>

<p>Economic viability of sovereigns is discussed elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="germany">Germany</h3>

<p>Germany is the economic and industrial powerhouse of Europe. Its products and demands are consumed in many countries.</p>

<h3 id="switzerland">Switzerland</h3>

<p>The Swiss have their own currency. Their economy is strong, but is heavily dependent on foreign demand for their products. Euro has been getting weaker relative to the Swiss Franc due to financial problems described elsewhere. So, in order to keep demand for its products high, the Swiss have had to artificially weaken their currency by promising a fixed, lower exchange rate.</p>

<h2 id="sovereigns-economic-viability">Sovereigns’ economic viability</h2>

<h3 id="financially-strong-sovereigns">Financially strong sovereigns</h3>

<p>German government is relatively efficient in collecting taxes and providing services.</p>

<h4 id="german-income">German income</h4>

<p>German citizens have a keen memory of the inter-bellum period when run-away inflation occurred. So, they are strongly resistant to irresponsible government spending which could lead to similar devaluation. Also, they are willing to pay relatively high taxes, and have of late even agreed to lower job security.</p>

<h4 id="france">France</h4>

<p>French banks have high exposure to Greek sovereign debt. So, they may need to be resuced by the French sovereign.</p>

<h3 id="financially-weak-sovereigns">Financially weak sovereigns</h3>

<p>As of 2011: Some countries, given relatively easy access to debt, mismanaged government economy.</p>

<h4 id="greece-portugal">Greece, Portugal</h4>

<p>Greece lied to others about the state of their economy in order to join the Euro and pretend compliance with the associated demands. Greek politicians used money acquired from debt to pay unrealistically high wages to state employees. Its tax-collectors are deliberately inefficient.</p>

<p>The case of Portugal is similar.</p>

<h4 id="ireland">Ireland</h4>

<p>The Irish, poor for a millennium, became rich as population growth declined due to increased popularity of contraception in the traditionally Catholic nation. They then used easily granted debt to buy land and build (now wasted) buildings in a real-estate boom. The Irish banks then had to be rescued by the sovereign, which reduced the financial health of the Irish government.</p>

<h4 id="iceland">Iceland</h4>

<p>Icelanders, given easy access to debt, sought to use the money in buying goods and services abroad which they could not afford with the goods and services they exported. The anticipated domestic growth to pay this debt was unrealistic.</p>

<p>Some lenders were ordinary people: For example, banks promised high interest on foreign currency deposits. Icelandic government had to then make up for atleast the domestic commitments of its banks.</p>

<h1 id="china">China</h1>

<p>Chinese economy is growing at a fast pace. Politically, China seems to be stable in the short to medium term.</p>

<h2 id="manufacturing-1">Manufacturing</h2>

<p>China has a trade surplus relative to the USA. It is a manufacturing hub.</p>

<h2 id="media">Media</h2>

<p>China, due to tight censorship, does not seem to be a hot-spot for internet businesses. It blocks Facebook, twitter - anything which can be used to organize subversion of the government.</p>

<h2 id="middle-class">Middle class</h2>

<p>1.4% of urban households make more than $15,000 a year, and only 11% make $5,000-15,000. Chinese people have high savings, low borrowing tendencies, because unless they work for the state they are unlikely to receive much of a pension. Consumer inflation is officially 5.3% but probably higher.</p>

<h2 id="yuan">Yuan</h2>

<p>Yuan is set to appreciate in value relative to the dollar eventually - though it is being gamed in the reverse direction by the government restricting Yuan access to foreigners.</p>

<h3 id="lending">Lending</h3>

<p>Chinese funds and government lend excess dollars to USA by buying US bonds. They do this in order to get rid of excess dollars and keep export profitable to their producers in the short-term, thereby encouraging further growth in the exports business.</p>

<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>

<p>1989 saw the Tianmen square crackdown.</p>

<h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>

<p>The communist party tried to eradicate religion starting from the cultural revolution - they tortured monks, destroyed monasteries. But this ceased in 1982. After economic growth in the 1990’s, recognizing a popular feeling of spiritual emptiness, the party promoted religion as an important part of developing a harmonious society, provided they support the party. Those that disagree are suppressed: Eg: Falun Gong, Catholic Church, some Tibetian Buddhism.</p>

<h1 id="india">India</h1>

<p>High political stability.</p>
