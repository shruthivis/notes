<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<h3 id="the-goal-in-case-of-research">The goal: in case of research</h3>

<p>The ultimate objective is to be fruitful in the exploration of the
worlds of scientific and mathematical ideas (aka research).</p>

<p>This pertains to tricks and tactics useful in</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>extracting and memorizing, understanding important information from
books, articles, lectures;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>acquiring proof/ thought strategies and skills used therein.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="signs-of-understanding">Signs of understanding</h4>

<p>Ability to reduce everything to elementary school mathematics signifies
true understanding.</p>

<p>Ability to solve textbook problems is another important sign.</p>

<p>Ability to reproduce complex proofs without notes, thinking and
remembering on the spot.</p>

<h2 id="deliberate-practice">Deliberate practice</h2>
<p>Get frequent, accurate feedback - either by examining your own skills
(eg: reading papers), or by listening to/ talking to others.</p>

<h2 id="learning-with-courses">Learning with courses</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Also see the strategy for learning from lectures in career skills
strategy document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read before attending the lecture. Read after the lecture. Tackle
exercises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Befriend and acquire contact details of at least 3 students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bringing photocopies of relevant pages of the book to the class
helps in quick understanding and orderly recording.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regularly attend office hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can contribute to the discussion and lectures in the classroom
in exactly two ways: By asking questions, or by answering questions.
Contribute cleverly in both ways, and you will be considered an
attentive student.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take easy courses, which are short on labor, and which are of
appropriate level. Some students take courses even until they
graduate. This ensures that knowledge acquired does not dissipate
due to disuse. Research is more important.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider ut CIS survey ratings, ratemyprofessor.com, utlife.com
ratings before taking courses.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exam-strategy">Exam strategy</h3>

<p>Read up homework solutions and results; write them in cheat-sheet. Solve
many problems as warmup. Beware the calculation mistakes. Use separate
sheets for separate questions. Don’t over hydrate yourself. Sleep well.
Solve easy, short questions first; solve many questions parallelly.</p>

<h2 id="general-ideas">General ideas</h2>

<h3 id="knowledge-gathering-for-research">Knowledge gathering for research</h3>

<h4 id="picking-knowledge-to-gather">Picking knowledge to gather</h4>

<p>Deep understanding about a narrow area should be balanced with broad
knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="deepening-knowledge-and-research-skills">Deepening knowledge and research skills</h4>

<p>Read about great discoveries, so that you can replicate great
discoveries.</p>

<p>Then check your understanding and skills. See that section.</p>

<h5 id="critiquing-others-work">Critiquing others’ work</h5>

<p>Use the research article review checklist.</p>

<p>Critique the problem. Critique the posited solution. Discuss your
critiques with others; thereby improve critiquing skills; gather their
observations. Critique the novelty of the problem and the solution.</p>

<h4 id="acquisition-of-wide-knowledge">Acquisition of wide knowledge</h4>

<p>Know a million theorems. Keep playing around with all sorts of ideas,
techniques and tools. Don’t be scared of experts and their jargon.</p>

<p>Attend talks. There is a high correlation between those students who are
doing the broadest and deepest work and those who are regularly
attending seminars.</p>

<p>Talk to other graduate students. A lot. Organize reading groups. Be
enthusiastic about reading and presenting papers. (Like PJ.) Also talk
to post-docs, faculty, visitors, and people you run into on the street.
They can give you ideas unrelated to what you were thinking. Don’t worry
too much about impressing them. Don’t be scared to ask basic questions -
and don’t be surprised when nobody knows the answers.</p>

<h4 id="good-progress">Good progress</h4>

<p>Without fail, read 3 papers every week.</p>

<h3 id="checking-understanding">Checking understanding</h3>

<h4 id="challenges-and-exercises">Challenges and exercises</h4>

<p>A common Atma-vaÑchanaM is to fool oneself into thinking that one’s
skills and knowledge in a subject is sufficient for research. Hence,
challenges of others, exercises and self-testing is extremely important.
Experience shows these.</p>

<p>Thence you recognize holes in your knowledge and skills. The more holes
you find in your knowledge and skills, the better it is.</p>

<h4 id="questioning-and-inquiry">Questioning and inquiry</h4>

<p>NEVER be lazy about asking questions. Ask yourself as many questions
(especially about the object of study) as possible.</p>

<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>

<p>Other people ask questions to satisfy their own curiosity, and to
desmonstrate a flaw in your knowledge and skills. Both of these are
good.</p>

<p>Exams, homeworks, exercises are others.</p>

<p>Talk to people. Clearly state your ideas, so that they may criticise
them.</p>

<p>Thence, challenges should be encouraged and embraced.</p>

<h2 id="learning-from-technical-interactions">Learning from technical interactions</h2>

<h3 id="talking-to-others">Talking to others</h3>

<h4 id="importance">Importance</h4>

<h5 id="in-learning">In Learning</h5>

<p>Talk to others about subjects you wish to learn. In the act of
expressing your understanding of the subject, you and others will find
and correct mistakes. Furthermore, you get new knowledge.</p>

<h5 id="in-research">In research</h5>

<p>This is also an important source of high-quality technical
collaborations: with a new perspective, the problem (yours or the one
faced by another person) is tackled more easily.</p>

<h4 id="procedure">Procedure</h4>

<p>Don’t worry too much about impressing them. You ask questions, make
mistakes or you will be hiding your stupidity for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Ask for questions and clarifications.</p>

<h4 id="on-the-internet">On the internet</h4>

<p>Very useful technical exchanges can happen on the internet Eg: math
stackexchange, stackoverflow.</p>

<p>Research interactions are considered in the Career Survey.</p>

<p>Socially curated news from researchers is considered in the ’reading’
part, while online lectures are considered in the ’lecture’ section.</p>

<h3 id="learning-from-lectures">Learning from lectures</h3>

<h4 id="importance-and-purpose">Importance and purpose</h4>

<h5 id="the-learning-process">The learning process</h5>

<p>(Ravi Vakil) You’ll hear various words, whose definitions you’re not so
sure about. At some point you’ll be able to make a sentence using those
words; you won’t know what the words mean, but you’ll know the sentence
is correct. Later you’ll learn the meanings and fill in the details more
efficiently.</p>

<h5 id="relevance-to-research">Relevance to research</h5>

<p>It is amazing what can become relevant to your research. You won’t
believe it until it happens to you.</p>

<h4 id="approximation-of-private-tuition">Approximation of private tuition</h4>

<p>The purpose of attending a lecture is to learn from the lecturer’s
insights, opinions and ways of solving problems. Private tuition is far
better than a lecture. But lecture exists due to lack of sufficient
number of tutors. If you cannot follow what is going on, and if it is
not too disruptive, ask. If you are lost, ask the lecturer to do an
example.</p>

<h4 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h4>

<p>An acquired skill: Learning to get information out of research seminars
is an acquired skill, usually acquired much later than the skill of
reading mathematics.</p>

<h4 id="maintaining-attention">Maintaining attention</h4>

<p>Try to ask one question at as many seminars as possible, either during
the talk, or privately afterwards. The act of trying to formulating an
interesting question focuses the mind.</p>

<p>Try pretending that you will be scored based on your understanding of
the lecture.</p>

<p>Sit in the front of the class. During lectures, one must respond with
gestures in order to indicate interest.</p>

<h5 id="following-the-talk">Following the talk</h5>

<p>Try to follow the thread of the talk, and when you get thrown, try to
get back on again. This isn’t always possible, and admittedly often the
fault lies with the speaker. The initial parts of the talk is very
critical.</p>

<p>Check claims; consider limits, exercise intuition, use calculation.</p>

<p>Take text or slides to the lecture, if available.</p>

<h4 id="post-talk-discussions">Post-talk discussions</h4>

<p>Befriend a couple of other attendants. Talk to them and to professors
attending the talk, question them about the lecture, acquire their
insights.</p>

<p>Try to answer the questions: What question(s) is the speaker trying to
answer? Why should we care about them? What flavor of results has the
speaker proved? Do I have a small example of the phenonenon under
discussion? See if you can get one lesson from the talk. Criticize the
problem and the solution; see how you can apply ideas thence to your
work.</p>

<p>Try to extract three words from the talk and learn their definitions.
Assimilate notes immediately after the lecture: avoid backlogs.</p>

<h4 id="on-the-internet-1">On the internet</h4>

<p>Video lectures and university course lectures are useful.</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

<h3 id="focus-on-ideas-vs-text">Focus on ideas vs text</h3>

<h4 id="focus-on-ideas">Focus on ideas</h4>

<p>In general, one must read books/ passages with the intention of mining
it for problems, ideas and knowledge, and for training the brain in
solution strategies, not to read it from cover to cover. So, ignore
unimportant information.</p>

<p>Given a research paper, one must get to the interesting information as
rapidly as possible.</p>

<h4 id="focus-on-word-smithery">Focus on word-smithery</h4>

<p>Sentence level focus is sensible in rare cases: eg: relishing exquisite
word-smithery.</p>

<h4 id="focii-in-reading-fiction">Focii in reading fiction</h4>

<p>One may focus on various ways of being (character, intellect, desires,
behavior), uncommon circumstances (physical laws) and
socio-economic-political conditions. One may compare these characters
and conditions with those observed in actual life.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-what-to-read">Choosing what to read</h3>

<p>To find knowledge and interesting ideas, some works are more suitable
than others.</p>

<h4 id="general-knowledge">General knowledge</h4>

<p>News is described elsewhere.</p>

<p>Course-notes posted on the websites of university instructors and
encyclopedias like the wikipedia are very useful in getting some good
knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="research-papers">Research papers</h4>

<p>Theses are often more detailed and friendly than journal papers. Journal
papers are often better written than conference papers. Single author
papers are usually more carefully written. So, reading them in great
depth is a good way to enter a field.</p>

<h3 id="parsing-and-understanding">Parsing and understanding</h3>

<h4 id="history">History</h4>

<p>Comprehending passages reached a peak while preparing for the GRE
general test. There reading comprehension questions tested ability to
determine the general purpose of a given passage, find answer to
specific questions using information presented, make (and critique)
inferences (verbal reasoning).</p>

<h4 id="seeking-ideas">Seeking ideas</h4>

<h5 id="grossness-and-separation">Grossness and separation</h5>

<p>To seek ideas efficiently and effectively, one needs to view the
material at various levels of grossness. For this reason, it is
important to maintain some distance from the text.</p>

<h5 id="getting-an-overview">Getting an overview</h5>

<p>Some portions of the text offer a more high level view than others.
These ought to be read first.</p>

<p>Eg: The abstract and concluding paragraphs of an article, the first and
last sentences of a paragraph. Sentences marked by structure indicators/
transition words like ’although’ and ’but’.</p>

<p>Determine structure from titles first. Glance at figures and captions.</p>

<h5 id="repeated-summarization">Repeated summarization</h5>

<p>Summarize to yourself repeatedly to understand and remember what the
passage is trying to say. Don’t just verify correctness, ask “Why?”.
Guess the author’s motives whilst reading. (Eg: Why did he choose that
value for the interval?)</p>

<h5 id="understand-the-author">Understand the author</h5>

<p>The author’s viewpoint, which may be different from the ideas you
identify, is often important and informative.</p>

<p>To understand this viewpoint, observe where the author spends much of
his time, how the text builds up support for a certain bunch of ideas.</p>

<p>One flaw is to be fooled by red-herrings - ideas which are not central
to the author’s thesis.</p>

<h5 id="iterative-progress">Iterative Progress</h5>

<p>Reading someone’s deep work can be overwhelming. It is important to not
let this happen. Find one small idea to conquer and digest at a time,
and conquer it. Then repeat.</p>

<p>To ensure steady progress, keep track of your current position in the
book/ article, so that you may continue from that point at a later date:
One can recollect forgotten knowledge using one’s notes.</p>

<h4 id="considering-ideas">Considering ideas</h4>

<h5 id="interestingness">Interestingness</h5>

<p>Pick one of the ideas the author is trying to communicate, see if you
are interested in it. Repeat this until you find an interesting idea.</p>

<h5 id="understandability">Understandability</h5>

<p>Check if the interesting idea is something you can understand by
attempting to understand it. If you cannot understand the idea,
determine what prerequisites you must satisfy to be able to understand
it. If you are so inclined, satisfy the prerequisites and repeat this
step with that idea.</p>

<h5 id="grok-significance-of-ideas">Grok significance of ideas</h5>

<p>Read examples/ counterexamples or find your own. Simulate operations in
toy models to understand general relationships.</p>

<p>Consider relationships with previous knowledge. Besides being very
natural and enjoyable, such exercises and associations ensure that the
brain does better at retaining important information.</p>

<h4 id="dealing-with-dense-passages">Dealing with dense passages</h4>

<p>Read with writing material. Complicated passages may require diagrams
and external symbol manipulation to understand. Also, while reading
mathematics, writing the important parts and leaving out the fluff helps
immensely. Also, tracing mathematical formulae, which are dense in
information, ensures that all essential information is noticed.</p>

<p>Considering the ideas presented themselves is described elsewhere.</p>

<h5 id="graphical-process">Graphical process</h5>

<p>In each sentence/ paragraph, scan for important entities (nouns which
are objects, subjects, actors) and actions(verbs).</p>

<p>Understand the relationship amongst these entities by visualizing them
as a graph. This can be a slow process.</p>

<h4 id="signs-of-understanding-retention">Signs of understanding, retention</h4>

<p>Writing short summaries and doing exercises for the purpose of retention
are described elsewhere. This can be interleaved with the process of
parsing.</p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<h4 id="content-type">Content type</h4>

<p>This could be research news, news from friends through social media,
newspapers etc..</p>

<p>They often tend to be short messages leading to other links. Sometimes,
they are followed by discussions.</p>

<h5 id="research-news">Research news</h5>

<p>Besides internet journals and pre-print collections, twitter feeds and
blogs of researchers tend to be a very good source of research news.</p>

<p>Lectures and course-notes are considered separately.</p>

<h4 id="curation-of-articles-and-comments">Curation of articles and comments</h4>

<p>News can be chosen, curated, arranged and presented either by a small
group of professional editors (Eg: BBC, Time, etc..); or by a democratic
process where a huge group of readers vote articles up and down (Eg:
Reddit, Digg).</p>

<p>Comments may also be curated by an editorial process (presented in the
form of letters to the editor), or they may be curated and rated by a
democratic system of votes (as in the case of Reddit, Ted talks,
Youtube).</p>

<h4 id="selectivity-filtering">Selectivity, filtering</h4>

<p>To get good return for the time spent following news, filtering and
curation is essential. Good sources, from experience are: reddit, ted
talks, podcasts such as Planet Money, BBC.</p>

<p>Sometimes this must be done manually. For example, in Facebook, classify
people depending on the topics they post about, and zealously unfollow
news feeds of people who consistently reduce the quality of your
combined news feed.</p>

<h2 id="retain-important-knowledge-skills-discover-problems">Retain important knowledge/ skills, discover problems</h2>

<p>General properties of memory and various techniques for strengthening
memory is considered elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="retention-of-important-knowledge">Retention of important knowledge</h3>

<h4 id="reconstruction-ability">Reconstruction ability</h4>

<p>One must be able to reconstruct important knowledge acquired so far,
relevant to the subject being studied, from scratch. This must be done
with minimal external reference, and with the power of one’s memory and
abilities. This is helpful in preparing the mind for studies and in
solidifying knowledge. For thoroughness of topics covered, a reference
sheet may be used.</p>

<p>Being able to reproduce complex proofs without notes is an important
skill. Eg: Pradeep presenting many proofs of statistical learning
theory, VCD, packing number etc.. PratIka presenting ICML papers.</p>

<h4 id="notes-surveys">Notes/ surveys</h4>

<h5 id="identify-core-ideas">Identify core ideas</h5>

<p>A complex concept is just an arrangement of a few simple ideas. This is
important while making notes.</p>

<p>Learning involves repeated summarization.</p>

<h5 id="succinct-summarization">Succinct summarization</h5>

<p>Record important patterns of ideas and solution strategies, with
examples/ counter-examples and important results. View surveys as
embedding the graph of ideas in two dimensions. The idea is to embed a
network of ideas on a sheet.</p>

<p>Capture the most central ideas; ideas which evoke the strongest and the
most unusual reactions. Ignore the rest. Be able to summarize the
essentials of a paper in a few paragraphs/ sentences. This is useful as
a mnemonic, as a useful device while re-reading the details, and as a
block to be used in reasoning.</p>

<h5 id="vividness">Vividness</h5>

<p>In the surveys, note important and surpising things, which evoke a
reaction other than the usual; make things vivid. Consider making them
colorful.</p>

<p>Ignore and skip unimportant information.</p>

<p>For closeness to the subject, it is important to have favorite examples.</p>

<h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3>

<p>Often work out small details while reading.</p>

<p>ALWAYS attempt for a reasonable time to work out the solution strategy
yourself before looking up the proof or the solution to the problem.
This is very important training in problem-solving in that area. It is
also important in the development of intuition.</p>

<h4 id="tackling-not-solving">Tackling, not solving</h4>

<p>The point is to tackle, not necessarily solve. This is very important
training in problem-solving in that area.</p>

<h4 id="review-attempt">Review attempt</h4>

<p>Even if you read the solution, consider what you *could* have done to
solve the problem.</p>

<h3 id="mining-for-fresh-problems">Mining for fresh problems</h3>

<p>It is very important to critique a paper or a talk, understand its
shortcomings, suggest future improvements. Thence, incremental research
occurs.</p>

<p>OFTEN, perturb the problem and extrapolate a solution. This is a very
important skill.</p>
