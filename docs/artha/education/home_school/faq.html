    <h2 id="motivation-and-intro">Motivation and intro</h2>

<ul>
  <li>People with narrow backgrounds (never having seen gifted and normal homeschooled kids, themselves products of “factory model” education) find it hard to appreciate the benefits of homeschooling, while finding it easy to see supposed downsides. Hence this section. Here we try to answer some common objections from our perspective.</li>
  <li>But, please see other objection lists below. Where possible we try to avoid repeating answers.:

<h2 id="socialization">Socialization</h2>

<p><strong>Objection:</strong> He has learn to fight and cooperate with other people (kids). He has to learn how to live in the larger society. With homeschooling, this will be stunted.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our kids will have plenty of opportunities to fight and cooperate with other kids - and even adults. They will be adequate (unsupervised) playtime.</li>
  <li>Company that a child gains at school is pretty random - and not necessarily healthy overall. Several of the little brats will be mean bullies, dullards and otherwise indigent. We know of children lost and dispirited due to bullying. With our techniques, we will aim to provide a healthy and dhArmika peer group - while allowing for <em>small</em> exposure to the mean, the bad and the ugly.</li>
  <li>Examples of activities
    <ul>
      <li>India
        <ul>
          <li>The kids will go to daily RSS shAkhA-s, volunteer at various dhArmika initiatives and be quite well equipped to cooperate for dharma - and crack open enemy skulls.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sub-objection</strong>: Aren’t RSS and the like a bit radical/ extreme? <strong>Answer</strong>: No! That’s your silly perception. It is extreme - ie extremely good. We want to be extremely good hindu-s. Even our fathers happily participated.</li>

<h2 id="professional-teachers-and-their-cost">Professional teachers and their cost.</h2>

<p><strong>Objection:</strong> Professional teachers are better than you. Tutoring is costly and hard to come by - you cannot afford it.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where science, math and languages are concerned - our family is quite self sufficient; given that we hold advanced degrees in the sciences, have engineering and research experience and are quite well read in Sanskrit, English, Kannada and Hindi. So, just one of us can hold the fort in those regards. So, external tutoring needs here are minimal.
    <ul>
      <li>Same with several outdoor activities - hiking, snowboarding, swimming …</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With regard to the arts (music, dancing, vedic chanting), we are as capable of funding special classes as parents of school-goers. If you think you’re close enough to us, we can discuss and prove our financial solvency beyond doubt.</li>
  <li>It is our objective (not arrogant) opinion that the average school teacher (dividing his attention among a class full of kids) is much less skilled, knowledgeable and experienced (in the real world) than us.</li>
  <li>Special teachers and classes:

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="discipline">Discipline</h2>

<p><strong>Objection</strong>: The kid won’t listen to and learn from you. <strong>Discipline</strong> is required - school can give that better.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a tradeoff between discipline and freedom to pursue one’s natural learning preferences. We prefer to not shove “learning” down the child’s throat - to the extant possible, while still focusing on imparting important and basic skills and knowledge (listed <a href="https://checkvist.com/checklists/575542-desiderata">here</a>).</li>
  <li>Discipline is important -
    <ul>
      <li>those of us responsible for educating the child are confident in our ability to firmly and calmly enforce rules required of a brahmachArin - while being careful not to spark counter-productive rebellion. (Eg. to note: we have experience increasing our household saMskAra-s.)</li>
      <li>Discipline will be inculcated indirectly via special activities and classes (veda memorization, RSS shAkha-s, volunteering, … ); and through sagely lore.  (Personality shaping would have to be done in such an indirect way that the subject would not realize exactly how he is being shaped until it’s just a deep essential part of who he is.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It is true that some skills and knowledge is imparted better in the company of other students. For example: vedic chanting and memorization, songs, dance, games.. We will ensure that such company is not lacking within those contexts.</li>
  <li>Mastery over many other skills and branches of knowledge is a matter of (mostly) solitary effort - and our personal coaching more than suffices. This we know from our own learning experience - we did not benefit so much from peers in our studies of history, civics, chemistry or mathematics. That said, in the age of the internet (<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com">https://math.stackexchange.com</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>, reddit, …) and exams, learning will by no means happen in isolation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-does-it-idiots-and-paupers">Who does it? Idiots and paupers. </h2>

<p><strong>Objection</strong>: Home-schooling is for “special” kids with learning disabilities or poor kids.
<strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every child is a special child - with special interests and abilities, so factory model is suboptimal in the first place.</li>
  <li>It is true that some kids resort to open/ home schooling out of compulsion as a second choice. On the other hand -highly gifted children, as well as normal kids, as well as those with learning disabilities <strong>opt for</strong> home-schooling. See examples listed below.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">She then took her children out of their elite private school in Pennsylvania and started home schooling. Ask Vijaya the reason, and she says, “The school they went to had children from highly well-to-do families and immense peer pressure to conform to pop culture, which was not aligned with our core values. That apart, I felt home schooling will teach them far more than what they learn in schools.” She taught them physics and mathematics, while English and fine arts were ‘outsourced,’ and they gave regular exams online. After relocating to India, the brothers did attend school but immediately discontinued. Siddhartha and Ashok are currently learning from the Stanford University’s online high school curriculum and give standardised examinations. Both boys state that they don’t miss formal school. They have time to pursue music and play the violin, apart from attending Veda classes and teaching Sanskrit. They are also learning Carnatic music from Trivandrum G. Seethalakshmi Ammal and the violin from Charumathi Raghuraman. Siddhartha says he is studying rare compositions from Padmashree SR Janakiraman.</code></li>

<h2 id="degrees-and-college">Degrees and college</h2>

<p><strong>Objection</strong>: What about degrees and college?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Various boards allow private candidates to take up public exams for school-leaving certificates. This is a well established practice, even in India. See below for links.</li>
  <li>We will aim to have kids be more than academically ready for college far earlier than regular school going kids. (School tends to be a big waste of time.) Social readiness for hostel-life may have to wait for some time - or it may happen sooner.
    <ul>
      <li>Many young homeschooled kids in CA (as of 2018) happily take college courses at local community colleges.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="someone-like-you">Someone like you!</h2>

<p><strong>Objection: </strong>If you are a kid’s guru, he will become a “bad” person like you.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firstly, get lost.</li>
  <li>In any case, the kid’s parent/ tutor is not the only influence on him - he’ll have plenty of role models to follow.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outcomes-and-stats">Outcomes and stats</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A big paid bibliography is avaliable at <a href="https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/">NHERI site</a> for you to buy. (We’re satisfied with anecdotes and public data, thank you.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ineffectiveness-of-conventional-education">(In)Effectiveness of conventional education</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Sociologists Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa presented data showing that, over their first two years of college, students typically improve their skills in critical thinking, complex reasoning and writing by less than a fifth of a standard deviation.” {<a href="https://twitter.com/clairlemon/status/1066195460476399616">TW18</a>}</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2018-stats">2018 stats</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are about 2.3 million home-educated students in the United States (as of spring 2016). This is up from one estimate that there were about 2 million children (in grades K to 12) home educated during the spring of 2010 in the United States (Ray, 2011). It appears the homeschool population is continuing to grow (at an estimated 2% to 8% per annum over the past few years). An estimated 3.4 million U.S. adults have been homeschooled for at least one year of their K-12 years, and they were homeschooled an average of 6 to 8 years. If one adds to this number the 2.3 million being homeschooled today, an estimated 5.7 million Americans have experienced being homeschooled. </li>
  <li>The home-educated typically score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests. (The public school average is the 50th percentile; scores range from 1 to 99.) A 2015 study found Black homeschool students to be scoring 23 to 42 percentile points above Black public school students (Ray, 2015).</li>
  <li>The home-educated are doing well, typically above average, on measures of social, emotional, and psychological development. Research measures include peer interaction, self-concept, leadership skills, family cohesion, participation in community service, and self-esteem.</li>
