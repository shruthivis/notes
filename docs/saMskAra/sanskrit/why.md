## Why Sanskrit?

- Most of all, to attain and preserve the pinnacles of the hindu way (in social and self cultivation). To preserve the dharma which protected our virile ancestors and enabled them to thrive accross a stunning span of time and space.
    - Just as pANini's system (checked and approved by the sagely tradition) is a peg for Sanskrit - keeping it from deviating too far from the shiShTa-usage for 2500+ years, sanskrit itself is large part of a peg for the classical Indo-Aryan memeplex which keeps it from deviating too far from the sages' vision.﻿ This is in fact why such sanskrit attained dominance in the ancient hindu world in the first place ([KV16](https://kashcidvipashcit.wordpress.com/2016/05/19/%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%83-%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5/)).
    - There are many ways in this world for self-cultivation, understanding and contributing towards dharma, developing skills useful for daily life etc.. One excellent way is our very own hindu-sampradAya-dhArA. An important component of this way is knowledge of saMskRtam, using which our pUrvaja-s (ancestors) expressed their deepest thoughts, which contains the most excellent vocabulary for reasoning about the human condition and dharma, and finally, which is necessary to feel the full impact of our samskAra-s (rituals, mantra-s etc..). Indeed, as it is said - "samskRtiH samskRte AshritA", and it should be revived and made stronger if our distinct ancient stream of consciousness is to flow with full force for the benefit of all of humanity.

    - For a hindu, this is the most important reason for valuing sanskrit. As a mere language with associated poetic conventions, it could have been adapted and fed by enemies of dharma like the sister IA language Persian. And it was/ is/ will be, to some small extant (various veda-nindaka-s, shaiste khan, assorted mlecCha indologists), as are other Indian languages (tamiL - muslim purANa [DP17](http://www.mid-day.com/articles/devdutt-pattanaik-a-purana-for-muslims/18465165)).
- To have a sense of history and belonging to the 5k+ year old hindu stream of thought and feeling.
    - Sanskrit readily provides a sense of closeness and inspiration from our ancestors. The finest among our (hindu) ancestors expressed themselves with Sanskrit. Their systematic way of thinking about a variety of topics (logic, metaphysics, mathematics, astronomy... ) are worth appreciating in the original. Who doesn't like to say: "some of our ancestors were geniuses!!"'? Would people not naturally find these topics more attractive if presented in the context of a culture they are steeped in?

    - For a richer mundane experience with Indian words/ concepts
        - All Indian languages, names and mythology provide much greater delight and meaning once you are able to discern the roots and origins of words you see - say prajJNA, vikAsa, vishvAsa and aparNA.
- To delve into remarkably clear hindu analyses (shAstra-s)
    - The first grammar, the first pronunciation system, mathematics etc.. are all presented in an extremely orderly manner.

- For expressiveness and sheer literary beauty.
    - As suhas says: "There is no denying it - Sanskrit is a glorious language. It succeeds supremely in coercing the reader to join the author in his flights of imagination. It enables poets to make the reader see more vividly, feel more acutely and filter the extraordinary from the noise of the ordinary. You can hear the clip-clop of horses on battle field, the pitter-patter of falling raindrops and the surge of ocean waves in the rise and ebb of its syllables. The rhymes and rhythms of its mellifluous meters are mesmerizing. Its structure allows eye-popping poetic acrobatics which are impossible in other languages. In short, Sanskrit is best at what it is -- being a language. It is one of the finest triumphs of the perennial human quest for ways to express the myriad hues in which the world manifests itself."

- To delve deeply into Hindu arts and aesthetics.
    - The theory behind Indian art and aesthtics have been developed in Sanskrit over the millennia - be it poetry, literary style, [dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV_DVf4wmYE&list=PL798BE0DBBDF1AA1D), drama, music, sculpture, architecture - and sincere practitioners who seek perfection (called mArgI-s, as distinct from deshi-s) to this day feel the need to return to the classic texts and therefore to the sanskrit language.
    - As patanjalI said with regards to sanskrit grammar: "The five reasons for studying Sanskrit grammar, as outlined in the Mahābhāṣya (‘the great commentary’) of Patañjali on the Aṣṭādhyāyī, are—rakṣā (preservation), uhā (modification), āgama (scriptural injunction), laghu (brevity), and asandeha (unambiguity). " ([NM16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw6swQpju7A))

### Other notes

- Note for hindu expatriates: I agree with [Elst](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.in/2012/05/hindu-survival-what-is-to-be-done.html), who says: "it is a waste to still your guilt feelings as an immigrant by forcing your children to learn a smattering of Bengali or Kannada. It is better to teach your children Hindu values, and if this has to take the form of a language, let it be Sanskrit".

- shrIvatsa's answer to "What everyone should know about Sanskrit?" [here](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-mind-blowing-facts-about-Sanskrit-What-should-everyone-know-about-Sanskrit-language).
- On the sanskrit/ prakrit distinction - and its antiquity:
    - Sanskrit literally means refined, prAkRt means natural/ innate (implying that it is not as polished/ standardized). This is analogous to the mArgii/ desii distinction in theater and dance.
    - There was non-uniformity in  peoples' education (due to opportunity, circumstance and taste). Naurally, the more educated, scholarly class used more refined language, art and customs - owing to their expending a greater amount of effort in study, standardization and codification (whether it is in grammar, dance or music). Hence, the "sanskrit/ prakrit" distinction is quite old, predating even the buddha and the shramaNa-s.
- Early history: On the standardization and varieties of sanskrit-like languages
    - Languages very close to Sanskrit was spoken by nearly ALL classes of people in the first millennium BC \[[Q13](https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-people-on-the-Indian-subcontinent-used-or-knew-Sanskrit-during-the-2nd-and-1st-millennium-BC)\]. "The available evidence, from the earliest Sanskrit plays and other literary works around the time of the Buddha, is that Sanskrit and the early Prakrits were mutually intelligible. ... Pāṇini did indeed base his grammar on the speech of the "cultured" or "educated" (śiṣṭa) people, but the fact that his discussion (and the later one of Patañjali) includes idiomatic usage and much slang does indicate it was spoken for all purposes (i.e., including worldly everyday stuff) at least." \[खट्वारूढः, तीर्थध्वाङ्क्षः\]
    - Even svara-s were in use. People who travelled to the north and south banks of the vipAsha (उदक् च विपाशः॥ ४।२।७३ – “अञ् प्रत्ययो भवति चातुरर्थिकः। अणो ऽपवादः। … स्वरे विशेषः। महती सूक्ष्मेक्षिका वर्तते सूत्रकारस्य।”)  (today’s Beas) river could hear that names of wells were pronounced differently, and pANini’s job was to describe it.
    - "Sanskrit was not (contrary to popular misinformed opinion) a single dialect. It was the grammatically and phonetically standardized form of spoken late-Vedic. ​For there to exist a standardized form of the language, there should be multiple non-standard forms that are in use. The very existence of Pāṇini's grammatical standard is itself the most potent proof of there having been multiple dialects of spoken sanskrit in the late-vedic period.​ The spoken dialects for which sanskrit grammar was composed can all be called sanskrit even though they did not obviously 100% agree grammatically or phonetically to the standard language in practice. Vestiges of these pre-standardized Old-Indic dialects survive from Indo-Aryan literature composed throughout the vedic period, particularly from the 5th-2nd centuries BCE (when a profusion of grammatical and phonetics texts were composed to standardize the spoken language). Vedic was not a single uniform dialect, it is the common name (umbrella term) given to several closely related spoken Indo-Iranian dialects of the Vedic period in South Asia (roughly 1500 BCE to 300 BCE)." \[[BVP17](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/_w1ShqfczhY/27iVBdXsCQAJ)\]
