<p>=======</p>
<p>The target membership:</p>
<p>Consider the following questions:</p>
<p>1. 1. Do you aspire for rationality? Are you attracted to simpler
explanations of natural phenomena which do not postulate rebirth
(पुनर्जन्म) and kaivalya? Do you think that many specific details of
events related by
the mythologies (पुराणानि, रामायण, महाभारत), are likely to be false -
despite their value in guiding us?<br>
</p>
<p>2. Do you consider yourself Hindu? Do you think that many noble ideas, values, habits, rituals of the various
Hindu cultures (such as yours) continue to remain relevant
today?</p>
<p>2a. Are you, for example, a yogI/ yogiNI? Or do you use mantra and
tantra to manage your sentiments in your dhArmic journey? Or does the
earnest
spirit of inquiry seen in the उपनिषदः, as in the "असतो मा सद्गमया
.." hymn, enthrall you with its scientific temper? Do you love
संस्कृत-भाषा?</p>
<p>2b. Every country and culture has its noble and ignoble aspects:
do you want to retain the noble parts of your culture while erasing
the ignoble parts? Are there many noble and relevant aspects to
this culture which imbibe values such as discipline, importance/
permanence of family, introspection, a
desire to question and seek the truth, प्रज्ञा, साधना etc..? Do you
think that many associated customs, rituals, stereotypes and
examples reinforce these values?</p>
<p>If many of your answers were roughly in the affirmative or if
your curiosity is aroused, we welcome you to join this group. So,
if you are an atheist/ agnostic/ pantheist Hindu, you fit right in;
regardless of which one of the many traditions/ tribes
(shaiva/ iyengar/ iyer/ smArta/ sikh/ jain/ shakta/ madhva etc..)
you come from.</p>
<p>=======</p>
<p>The purpose of this group:</p>
<p>0. To help rational Hindus connect and exchange ideas. This was
started in the spirit of the talk on "changing the world, tribes
and the internet" ( <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/seth_godin_on_the_tribes_we_lead.html">http://www.ted.com/talks/seth_godin_on_the_tribes_we_lead.html</a>.</p>
<p>1. 5000 years of Hindu tradition should not disappear because
Hindu parents do not understand their own religion and the reasons
behind their rituals, or because their children are confused or
embarassed by misinformation and superstition. The subversion of the
Hindu identity by Macaulayish and Marxist agendas must be subverted.<br>
</p>
<p>2. To discuss what it means to be a rational Hindu; to exchange
your favorite secular hymns and myths, for example; to discuss your
favorite customs; to discuss what behavior is rational and
relevant, and what is not.</p>

<p>3. Perhaps to one day collect relevant and noble values, ideas,
and traditions of various Hindu cultures on a website.</p><p>=======</p>
<p>Level of activity:</p>
<p>The members may often be busy with other aspects of their
lives.</p>
<p>=======</p>
<p>The image on the right is that of the astronomer and
mathematician Aryabhatta, who, among his other accomplishments,
posited a heliocentric theory of the solar system. His successors
such as varahamihira and brahmagupta speculated about the
gravitational force.</p>
