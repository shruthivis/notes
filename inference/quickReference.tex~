Based on \cite{russellNorvig}, and a course by Shlomo Zilberstein.

\chapter{Themes}
How to reason about the the world? What logic/ calculus is expressive enough, models the world naturally? Is it complete?

Given some axioms, can you prove a statement? When is a predicate or proposition with free variables satsifiable? Is it valid for all assignments?

\part{Logics}
\chapter{Propositional logic: 0th order logic}
\section{Propositions simple and compound}
\subsection{Assertions/ propositions}
Simple propositional variables: p, q, true, false. As assertion is a boolean formula; which can be viewed in several ways, including as a set or an event. These perspectives are described in the boolean functions survey.

\subsubsection{Compound propositions}
Compound propositions: simple propositions combined by logical connectives $\land \lor ..$; actually $\lor, \lnot $ enough.

So, these are propositions involving boolean free variables.  They state some relationship among simple propositions.

\subsubsection{Free variables, assignment, binding}
Take a compound proposition p: eg: $p \dfn q \land r$. Now, q and r are free variables in p.

Unless ye assign T/F to these free variables, ye can't decide the truth value of p. Truth of a proposition often follows from the semantics: $2>3$ is F.

Every complex proposition is a boolean fn. See boolean function ref.

\paragraph*{Assignment}
Notation: $p[q \assign T, r\assign F]$.

\subsubsection{Validity}
Validity: p is true for all assignments to free variable. If p is valid, can say 'p is true'.

\paragraph*{Theorem}
A true or valid proposition.

\subsubsection{Satisfiability}
Satisfiability as a constraint satisfaction problem.

\subsubsection{Limitations}
'Harry is sick' or 'sick' can be handled, but not 'x is sick'.

\subsection{Common compound propositions}
\subsubsection{Implication, equivalnce}
$p \implies q$: $p$ 'stronger' than $q$. Equivalence $\equiv$: $(p \implies q) \land (q \implies p)$. This notion of strength is natural when $p$ and $q$ are viewed as events or sets in the sample space; then we see that $E_p \subseteq E_q$.

\paragraph*{Properties}
$p \implies q \equiv \lnot p \lor q$. $\implies$ is transitive.

\subsubsection{Implications: Strengthening and weakenging}
FALSE or $a \land \lnot a$: the strongest possible assertion; TRUE: weakest assertion.

Can always strengthen LHS in implication, and weaken RHS. Eg: If $q \implies r; p \implies q$: Can say: $p \implies r$ or $p \implies q \lor s$.

View p as $\set{b1, b2: p[q \assign b1, p \assign b2] = T}$, a predicate or propositinal fn. Sets of stronger p are smaller.

\chapter{Other Logics}
\section{First order predicate logic}
Propositional logic with predicates, quantifiers. See Propositional logic section: many properties carry over.

\subsection{Predicate}
Eg: x is sick: 'is sick' is a predicate; thence get isSick(x). Can talk about relations between objects: R(x, y).

\subsubsection{Free variables}
In predicate $R(x, y), x$ and $y$ are free variables. Domain of discourse: The domain of $x, y$ and other free variables.

Upon assignment, or quantification eg: $R(x\assign 3, y \assign 2)$, predicate becomes a proposition.

\subsubsection{As a set}
Every predicate defines a set of values for which it is true. Eg: $x>3$.

\subsubsection{Quantifiers}
In propositional logic, we had to name each object, here we can quantify! $\exists, \forall$. Quantified predicate is actually a proposition.

\paragraph*{Notations}
$\forall x \in S: P(x)$.

Or $\forall x: x \in S: P(x)$ or $\forall x: Q(x): P(x)$: second part specifies domain of $x$.

\paragraph*{Special cases}
$\forall x \in \nullSet: P(x)$ is true; $\exists x \in \nullSet : P(x)$ is false.

\paragraph*{Loss of free variables}
$\forall x: x \in S: P(x)$ has no free variable, but $\forall x: x \in S: P(x, y)$ does.

\subsubsection{Validity and satisfiability}
Like propositional logic case, except now free variables need not be boolean.

Theorems/ valid compound predicates in predicate calculus are similar to theorems in propositional logic.

\subsection{Limitations}
Can't talk about relations over relations. Eg: G(R(x,y),z).

\subsection{Extra inference rules}
De morgan's laws over $\forall$ and $\exists$ now exist.

\subsubsection{Instantiation}
Universal instantiation: $[\forall x :: A(x)] \implies A(a)$.

Similarly existential instantiation.

\section{Fuzzy logic}
Could be 0.7 correct: not just correct or incorrect.

\section{Temporal logic}
Entailment. Also see co operator in distributed computing ref.

\chapter{Inference}
\section{Propositional logic inference}
\subsection{Knowledge bases}
\subsubsection{The knowledge base in Horn form}
Horn clause has at most 1 unnegated proposition.

\subsection{Proving validity of theorems}
Given a set of axioms and valid rules of inference $S = \set{s_i}$. Does $S \implies^{*} p$? Or is $p \equiv q$? So, want to see if a certain relationship between propositions holds.

The search for proofs.

\subsubsection{Using truth tables}
Suppose ye got a compound statement p involving $\set{p_i}$. Show that for any assignment of T/F to these propositions, p is true.

\subsubsection{Use rules of inference}
Eg: Modus ponens: $(p \land (p \implies q)) \implies q$. Strengthening and weakening of implications.

De Morgan law: $\lnot(p \land q) \equiv \lnot p \lor \lnot q$.

Contrapositive: $(p \implies q) \equiv (\lnot q \implies \lnot p)$.

\subsubsection{Resolution}
Take $s_i \dfn a \land b$ and $s_j \dfn \lnot a \lor b$; get $s_i \land s_j \implies $.

Resolution is complete.

\subsubsection{Forward chaining}
Start with predicates you have; combine them in various ways; keep doing this till you hit q. Look at this as a directed graph, with P as the root nodes.

\subsubsection{Backward chaining}
Start with q. Look at conditions Q which need to be satisfied for q to be true; now try to prove each condition in Q; do this recursively until you hit P.

\section{Applications}
Planning: q could be some state of the world. Initial state may be set of actions/ transitions and current state of the world.
