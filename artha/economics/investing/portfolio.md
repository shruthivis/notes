title: Portfolio design
---  


## Summary

- Pick a simple asset allocation model, stick to it, rebalance occasionally.
  - Possibly put a small portion of "extra" money in high-risk high-reward places. (NN Taleb's barbell strategy.)
- Initially, be equity heavy. But put some money in bonds (negatively correlated with equity).
  - USA - TSM core 5/8, SV tilt 3/8.
- Switch to fixed income heavy portfolio when retiring.
    - "Let us call the first set ensemble probability (concerned with a collection of people) and the second one time probability or ergodicity (concerned with one person through time). When you read investment recommendations based on long term returns of market - beware... they're conflating the two. If the investor has to reduce exposure to the market due to big expenses, his returns will be divorced from the market, period." - NN Taleb paraphrased.

## Investment horizon and age

One should be clear about the investment horizon: when does one intend to withdraw money from the fund, with what frequency etc..

#### Connection to risk

Long term investors (eg: very young people) are capable of taking greater risks than short-term investors (eg: older people, about-to-retire people); because they can afford to ride out market turmoil.

#### Long term investing

One should not be fooled by market jitters (or perhaps even by medium term booms and busts) in deciding on worthiness of securities; though jitters can be exploited later, while purchasing it.

## Equity vs negatively correlated items - balance.

- Allocating some portion to items negatively correlated with equity is a good way of dealing with years when the stock market is down (Eg. 2008, or the lost decade 2000-2010).
- Equity and bonds are negatively correlated (~ 0.33 - [PP](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&s=y&symbols=VTI+BLV+VBR&endDate=09%2F18%2F2017&timePeriod=4&numTradingDays=120)). So, sometimes when the stock market goes down, bonds might go up (or at-least not as down) and vice versa.
- Negative ETF-s are an option.

## Equity: Everything + small value approach

Abbreviations: Total Stock Market: TSM, SV: Small Value.

Principle: "Fama French three factor model of US fund returns explains the risk and return of diversified equity portfolios across three risk dimensions: market risk, size risk and value risk. Investors who employ a Fama-French tilt in their portfolio believe that overweighing small-cap stocks and value stocks provides a different return path than holding only the capitalization-weighted market itself. Fama and French view any excess return from tilting is a payoff for taking additional risk." - Rick Ferri [RF2014](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2014/07/17/to-tilt-or-not-to-tilt/#54ba6f4d4986), Fama [IMG](https://i.imgur.com/6RjBwEY.png). This analysis was made popular by the morningstar.com chart \[eg. [IMG](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/File:Three-Factor_Model_-_Morningstar.png)\].

Preferred Implementation:

- TSM core 5/8, SV tilt 3/8. Repeat internationally. The allocation was checked with FF factors published on Ken French’s website .

## Value investing

One judges the intrinsic value of a security, and buys it if the market value is less than this by a significant ’margin of safety’. One particularly focuses on value - rather than growth - businesses.

#### Identifying value securities

This can be difficult, despite the use of comparative measures of value, like P/E. Thus, it is advantageous to invest in areas which you understand - Or one can copy investments by reputed value-investor funds.

Usually, equities of small companies not yet discovered by the market fit this description.

One can ask the question: ’Will I be willing to privatize this business?’

#### Focus on differentiation

In addition, one may focus on well-differentiated, rather than generic, companies: this ensures that the underlying product retains an advantage in capturing customers even if competitors catch up. This was exploited by Warren Buffet, when he invested in Coca Cola.

## Broad investment in chosen sectors

### Picking a sector

Different sectors show different patterns of growth over a long period of time.

- Cyclical: Real estate, basic materials, consumer items like cars, financial services.

- Sensitive: Energy (including petroleum), technology, communication services, industrials. These show greater variation depending on current macroeconomic circumstances.

- Defensive (Monotonically small growth): Healthcare, essential consumer items (like food), utilities (electricity, water).


### ETF investing

One can invest in ETF’s tracking index funds. Similarly, one can invest in ETF’s tracking the bond and real-estate markets. To pick an ETF, consider its portfolio and deduce its potential profit/ risk.

## Bonds

Some allocation to bonds, through an ETF perhaps, reduces volatility. Bonds are specially susceptible to the interest-rate-increase risk.

#### Bond ladder

Bonds have a fixed maturity date. So, investors often build a ladder of bonds such that one bond or the other matures in a given time slot. This brings greater liquidity to the investment.

## Personal/ Family finance

#### Importance of planning

An individual earns money from employment when young and healthy; but eventually they retire or get sick- either early or after going old.

Many expenses are very predictable. Hence set up a retirement fund, children’s education fund, health/ emergency fund. Many people fail at doing this.

#### Goals

#### Lifestyle post-retirement

Different living conditions will require different incomes. Projected cost of living should be calculated considering the cost of living, adjusted to the rate of inflation at the future abode. Living wage estimates: [here](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/living-wage-individual).

To reduce need for money, one can lead a frugal lifestyle, live in a developing location/ country/ boat (at least part of the year) where cost of living is low and where, due to the exchange rate, savings in foreign currency can be exploited.

## Implementation

### Discipline

If you don't have much time to research, don't time the market (applies to most people).

#### Common under-performance

In a large study in 1991-1996, active traders (avg portfolio turnover was 75%) performed much worse than the market returns (5% difference ); they tended to trade mostly common stocks (with very few value stocks). Some individuals did much better, others did much worse, but the large majority of individual investors would have done better by taking a nap rather than by acting on their ideas. It is the cost of trading and the frequency of trading, not portfolio selections, that explain the poor investment performance. One model to explain this is that this excessive trading emanates from investor overconfidence.

### Rebalancing

- Rebalance as often as you like in tax free (retirement) accounts \[considering trading fees\], and perhaps annually on taxed accounts (short term gains tax is higher).
- When the market is down, you might want to buy more stocks - not because you want to "time" the market, but because your holdings don't match the target portfolio because of devalued equities. 

### Purchase and selling

#### Using options

Selling put options is a profitable way of investing in a certain security at a low enough price. Thus, one can try to buy the equity at the desired price, while simultaneously collecting the premium for selling the option.

Similarly call options can be used while selling an equity.
