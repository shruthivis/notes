## Discipline

If you don't have much time to research, don't time the market (applies to most people).

### Common under-performance

In a large study in 1991-1996, active traders (avg portfolio turnover was 75%) performed much worse than the market returns (5% difference ); they tended to trade mostly common stocks (with very few value stocks). Some individuals did much better, others did much worse, but the large majority of individual investors would have done better by taking a nap rather than by acting on their ideas. It is the cost of trading and the frequency of trading, not portfolio selections, that explain the poor investment performance. One model to explain this is that this excessive trading emanates from investor overconfidence.

## Rebalancing

- Rebalance as often as you like in tax free (retirement) accounts \[considering trading fees\], and perhaps annually on taxed accounts (short term gains tax is higher).
- When the market is down, you might want to buy more stocks - not because you want to "time" the market, but because your holdings don't match the target portfolio because of devalued equities.Â 

## Purchase and selling

### Using options

Selling put options is a profitable way of investing in a certain security at a low enough price. Thus, one can try to buy the equity at the desired price, while simultaneously collecting the premium for selling the option.

Similarly call options can be used while selling an equity.
