# Economic growth
## Economic value indicators

Certain numbers reveal the current evaluation of the economy. The health of the economy can be roughly viewed in terms of the financial health and confidence of 4 major components: consumers, banks, non-bank businesses, government.

Eg: Prices of critical commodities (like oil), value of index funds, growth in real estate prices, government debt, public debt.

### Gross domestic product

#### As a summary

This is a measure of the total gross income of the country.

#### Comparison with GPA

Like the GPA in case of academia, it is a good summary, but it does not include finer details which could be gleaned from the whole data, such as how rich an average person feels.

#### Avoiding overcounting

To avoid double-counting and to include all services and goods which go into making a certain product, only end-consumption is considered. To avoid over-counting, money spent on imported goods is not counted - that contributes to the exporting country’s GDP.

Goods produced during previous years is not included in the GDP - even if they continue to be consumed. Instead, an imputed rent is included in the calculation.

#### Environmental costs

The costs to the environment from economic activity leading to growth is not included in the GDP. These costs arise from decreased life expectancy, greater sickness, lesser tourist pleasure etc.. Cost to life expectancy can be calculated based on the higher salary yielded by increased risk to life (around 60$ more for .0001 greater risk in 2011).

On the other hand efforts at spending to repair environmental damage gets counted - eg: environmental damage from BP’s oil spill is not included, but money spent on clean-up effort is!

## Booms and busts

Economies generally keep cycling through periods of booms and busts (described below). This is due to heuristic way in which demand and supply are balanced.

### Boom

To meet demand, industry in certain sectors grow - often on borrowed money, counting on future profits. Industries indeed produce profit for some time, but production keeps increasing until production exceeds demand.

During this time, the industries’ economic value - or at least their evaluation by the securities market- grows. Their operating cost increases because they invest more and hire more workers. Banks are more willing to lend at low interest rates.

Consumers, being able to find employment and loans, feel richer and more confident in their spending.

Note that a boom is different from a bubble - which is a valuation error, rather than a overproduction problem.

### Bust

Aka recession.

#### Market causes and reactions

When production exceeds demand, some industries go bankrupt, defaulting on their loans. Prices of securities fall, because the market has by now learned that the demand for product(s) is lower than the supply.

#### Reaction of banks

If loans are too big, lender banks fail, or start hoarding capital in order to compensate for losses by becoming reluctant to make new loans.

##### Role of government

The government’s budget deficit has an impact on the interest rate on government debt, which inturn affects the rate of interest charged by banks in their lending.

#### Business response

Due to impeded entrepreneurship, GDP growth reduces drastically. Due to bankrupt industries, the economy may even shrink! Businesses which remain solvent respond by cutting costs (including laying of people), selling their goods and services for cheaper to attract consumers. Due to the cost cutting, companies may in fact make record profits!

#### Consumer behavior

Consumers feel poor due to falling prices and fears of unemployment, and don’t have confidence to spend.

#### Impact on prices

As consumers have less money to spend, prices may fall.

Because businesses do not expand their services, projected demand for oil actually falls. This leads to decreased price of oil and oil-related enterprises.

#### Recovery

To recover from a bust, consumer confidence must be restored, government should cut deficit, banks’ willingness to lend should increase, and businesses should feel confident to hire more people.

#### International Contagion

When a certain country is experiencing a recession, it can adversely affect others due to many reasons.

Countries whose businesses (especially banks) had lent to recession-hit businesses and governments experience greater risk. This triggers reduction in lending by banks.

Countries with otherwise healthy businesses which export goods to recession hit countries also face reduced profitability due to reduced demand and due to decrease in value of the recession-hit country’s currency.

## Investment

GDP growth usually requires investment in business enterprise. But, investments may have returns either in the short-term or in the long-term. Investment which responds to consumer demand yields immediate benefits, and is often favored.

Investments vary in quality: for example, a rich government investment firm can increase GDP by just building cities which will never be occupied in the desert.

### Consumer demand and public debt

Individuals borrow money, and they have to repay them. The purchasing power of people correspondingly decreases.

### High public debt

When the money they collectively borrow is close to the (projected) GDP (national money production), there is trouble - it means that people are collectively incapable of repaying their debts.

This has happened in USA in 1929 and in 2009; thus Americans have financed their high individual standard of living with borrowed money they cannot repay. This eventually may lead to most individuals in USA being less worthy of credit and investment - leading to economic depression.

### Global savings

Increased prosperity in many parts of the world has resulted in greater amount of money becoming available for investment. IMF tracks this number - it exceeds the world’s GDP 5-fold, at 83 trillion $ in 2009.

Investment managers seek to utilize this money by investing in something which yields good return and low risk, with emphasis being on one or the other depending on their recent experience (and partially based on their long-term education). Their willingness to take reasonable risk is important to spur continued GDP growth.

## Disadvantages

### Social costs

A society often pays an excessive price for economic growth in the form of environmental pollution, eroding social/ cultural values, compassion.

### Inflation

The injection of new money by governments to favor economic growth leads to inflation/ currency devaluation, which disproportionately affects the poor, for the following reason.

The poor spend a greater fraction of their income on food/ raw materials, whereas rich tend to spend a greater fraction of their wealth on services. During inflation, the price of commodities grows at a much greater rate than the price of services.

#### Growth imbalance

Thus, with growth, the monetary imbalance between the rich and the poor tends to grow.

## Effect of local disasters

Suppose that a natural disaster like a hurricane in the gulf coast of USA or a earthquake + tsunami + nuclear leak in a part of Japan (2011) occurs. Regardless of where such a disaster occurs, much wealth is destroyed, and the economy of the affected region is severely set back.

If the country where the disaster occurs is advanced - like Japan or USA, effect on the GDP may not even be noticeable both in the short and the long term. This is because, these countries have redundant economic units (roads/ industries) which compensate for the destruction; and they have savings or lines of credit which they can use to rebuild - such investment increases, rather than decrease the GDP.

But, if the country is poor (eg: Haiti earthquake 2010), and the affected region is economically important, redundancy is low, and the entire economy suffers as a result.

## Financial crises

Growth in economic value slows down drastically sometimes. The immediate cause for this disruption is a drop in investment/ money-lending due to varied reasons.

### 1929: great depression

#### Importance

A transformative event in world (especially US) history: disagreement about the goodness of new deal set lasted throughout the following century as rivalry between Democrats and Republicans in politics.

#### Boom + bubbles

In the 1920’s, there was over-investment and under-consumption - there was a boom and a bubble. The bubble burst.

#### Bust, credit crisis

There was over-indebtedness. Some banks crashed. Depositors withdrew money from other banks. So, remaining banks became reluctant to lend money. On Oct 29 1929, Stock market crashed.

#### Deflationary cycle

In response to rising unemployment and falling income, businesses - in order to sell goods - had to reduce prices. The reduced prices led to further decrease in wages; which in turn led to reduced prices and reduced profits, which in-turn fed the credit crisis. Thus vicious cycles were formed

Commodity prices, especially food (and therefore farmland) fell; and farmers got much poorer. Disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor had grown.

#### Hoarding savings

Some banks refused to accept new deposits, because they were unable to find satisfactory investments. So, people, for psychological reason, wanted to convert their currency to gold instead - which was possible because the currency was exchangeable for gold on surrender to the government.

#### Wrong fixes

To discourage hoarding of savings in the form of gold and to encourage investments, the inexperienced Fed tightened credit - this raised interest rates both for savings accounts and for loans - even though the opposite was required to encourage banks to lend money. Thus, the status quo continued.

International trade broke down: tariffs were increased in order to protect the profitability of local industry.

#### Ditching gold standard

UK, USA ditched the gold-standard - to discourage gold hoarding and perhaps because of the inadequacy of the gold reserve. This allowed currency to be printed to encourage banks to lend. Also, as a way of injecting money into the economy, the government started buying back gold at higher prices with newly printed money.

This was critical. Countries which ditched the gold standard later got out of the depression later.

#### New deal 1

FD Roosevelt took over from Hoover, promised vigorous experimentation to find some way out. He kept citizens informed through a radio show, stopped prohibition of liquor and was popular.

Farmers were paid not to grow crops - to raise food prices. Working hours and conditions favorable to workers was encouraged: growth which was favorable for the rich was slowed down. The huge unemployed population was employed by the government to build infrastructure. Banks, with government aid, were set to operate soundly; and small deposits were guaranteed by the government .

### 2008: sub-prime mortgages

#### Bad credit

At the most basic level, a lot of bad loans were made to consumers: not just in buying homes, but also in general.

##### Eager investors

In 2000, US federal bank indicated that government bonds will continue to offer low interest rates - at 1%; so investors managing global savings - which had recently grown due to rapid economic growth - eager to get profit despite risk sought investment avenues.

##### Bad mortgage-backed securities

At this time, people in the US financial industry invented mortgage-backed securities, by which investors could buy a share of ownership in loans. There was so much supply of investor money and such short supply of worthy investments, that people started making bad loans to people incapable of paying back in order to sell shares in these loans and make profit in the short term. Borrowers lied about their incomes - often encouraged to do so by lenders. Housing prices were also increasing, emboldening lenders into thinking that foreclosure would be a way to remain profitable even if borrowers defaulted.

#### Credit default swaps

Investors buying risky mortgage-backed securities got insurance/ bet that these securities will fail; and this insurance business was neither public nor regulated. So, insurers such as AIG failed.

#### Consequences

In 2007, people started defaulting, real estate prices fell. Investors lost much money.

##### Bank collapse

Banks (especially investment banks who created and held on to mortgage-backed securities) which invested in bad mortgages were insolvent (or solvent only in paper because they refused to liquidate their toxic assets at current market value).

##### Credit crisis

Money market mutual funds, which gave out short term loans to businesses (commercial paper market) partially suffered because of loans to those who invested in mortgage-backed securities, and such short term lending froze due to a panic. Investors who managed the global savings pool became very risk-averse.

So, this led to a big slow-down in investment as both types of investors were not willing to lend money -either to regain solvency in case of banks or due to risk aversion. This credit-crisis hit countries like Iceland, which were now unable to low-interest loans.

##### Effect on industry

Shrinking markets caused industries such as GM to fail.

##### Effect on consumers

Consumers lost jobs, owed huge debt, felt poorer and reduced spending.

##### Profit

Some mutual funds (like Magnetar) profited from this crisis because they understood, encouraged and bet against risky securities using credit default swaps.

Employees of investment banks who created the heavily traded risky  
mortgage-backed securities and ignored their fiduciary duty towards the investor got rich from bonuses earned from fees received by the bank.

#### Mitigation

Central banks created a lot of new money in a huge effort to encourage investment/ lending and thus growth; and to finance efforts to rescue failing businesses.

Banks and industries were rescued - Eg: by US government subsidizing people who bought toxic assets from banks at slightly higher prices.

#### Devaluation

Commodity prices (esp: oil price) increased.

# Government

## Services

Government agencies or companies hired by them are responsible for providing basic infrastructure - public health-care, roads, water, security, regulation, environment protection, foreign policy, arbitration - to the public.

## Design

### Branches

Government has 3 main arms: Legislative (to make laws and oversee policies), Executive (to provide services as designed at a high level by the legislature) and Judiciary (to take care of grievances, punish wrong-doing).

### Importance

Government design determines the type and the quality of the services provided by the government. Bad governments are often a result of bad design.

### Legislature

Legislatures have great power because they determine the laws/ policies; the executive and judiciary merely execute them.

Legislatures vary in the extant to which they fear the people rather than the people fearing them. The more the legislature fears the people, the better quality of life people often achieve.

#### Lobbying

Special interest groups (serving the interest of foreign nations, or industry segments, for example) try to influence, often very successfully, the laws and policies designed by the legislature in order to be favorable to them.

They may do these by propaganda and dialogue to honestly convince that the ideas they support are good - for not just the legislator. But, they also often resort to appealing to the self-interest rather than the legislator’s duty (except perhaps using a broader justification for the importance of staying in power) by supplying money for campaigns or by bribery.

## Formation

### Monarchy

In the past monarchy, based on armed or religous support, was common. Succession was based on very narrow nepotism - this often led to fragile states whose fortunes varied wildly over the generations: See nepotism section of business succession for details.

### Democracy

In democracies, legislatures are constituted by election. \[**Incomplete**\]

## Income

### Taxation

In exchange for government services, people and businesses pay taxes on their incomes/ gains (any increase in wealth). So, the government collects taxes on behalf of its citizenry.

#### Taxation rate and service level

Some highly ’socialist’ countries (Eg: Scandinavian countries, France etc..) tend to have high taxation rates, and provide excellent services to their citizens in return. Other countries, like USA, have low taxation rates and in return provide low-quality public services.

#### Capital gains

The quirks of capital gains tax is explained elsewhere.

### Tax rate discrimination

#### Based on residence

Income Tax rates are often different for legal residents and temporary visitors. IN USA, one is declared a US resident for tax purposes if he passes a ’substantial presence test’ (not counting days under exempt status- eg: foreign student/ scholar).

#### Progressive taxation

Entities earning more money (sufficiently large to fall in different bins/ ’tax brackets’) are usually taxed at a higher rate than others. This is essentially a means of income distribution - this is often done to increase the average well-being of citizens.

### Sales tax rate discrimination

Some goods attract higher sales taxes than others. This is different from the tax paid by manufacturers on their income.

This is motivated by the fact that these goods (eg: electricity produced from fossil fuels, tobacco, alcohol) come at a cost to the environment or society or health which would not be otherwise factored into the item price.

### Tax code ideals

#### Simplicity and loopholes

Economists accross the board agree that the tax code should be simple. The government wishing to earn money well and be fair should eliminate major loopholes: including concessions to the middle class such as mortgage tax exemption (which is discrimination against renters), health insurance contributions by employers etc..

#### Focus on consumption and pollution

Still others argue that corporate - perhaps even individual - income tax should be eliminated in order to spur the economic growth; instead consumption and pollution should be taxed.

### Natural resources

Natural resources - such as petroleum or minerals - form another source of income to the government.

#### Renter economies

For many countries- eg: Saudi Arabia and Libya - they form the major part (98% in Lybia) of the economy. So, the government in such countries - especially if it involves undemocratic self-perpetuation - need not provide good services to its people/ industries as long as they maintain the natural resource exploitation industry in good health. They just provide enough to keep people calm - not necessarily economically productive.

Resource-rich countries which break this curse tend to find a way to ensure that no single entity has control of resources.

### Import tariff

Aka customs duty. This is tax levied on the price of imported items.

#### Design factors

Complicated tariff rules form as a result of lobbying by industry groups within the country (aka protectionism by the government), while the desire to increase exports lead to international agreements requiring lowering tariffs.

It can also be a international politics instrument.

#### Enforcement

Manufacturers could be lying about the make of their products in order to incur lower tariffs. Or, smugglers could be importing goods without paying tariffs.

Inspectors and scientists working at ports test products and ensure that tariffs are applied.

## Budget deficits

Many cities, states and countries outside have greater expenditure than revenue, a gap which is often projected to widen as time passes.

### Quantification

Government deficit is often measured as a percentage of the GDP, which is much larger than the actual income of the government alone. Anything over 10% is considered too high.

### Expectations without willingness to spend

Often people expect unrealistically good public services from the government, without the willingness to spend a proportionate fraction of their income. So, politicians in many countries are elected based on promise to increase or maintain public services while reducing (rather than increasing) taxation - this results in the perpetuation of a budget crisis.

This is especially the case in countries where the affected taxpayers have significant say in choosing their rulers.

### Long term solution

The long term solution involves reducing expenditures (downsizing government services), increased taxation, later retirement age etc..

#### Increase burden on the rich

In the case of democracies and socialist countries, one solution is to place a higher tax burden on the rich. But, people in countries characterized by a phobia of socialism or by general optimism where people are rich or expect to become rich, this is rejected.

### Short term solution

Temporary measures to combat it include borrowing money by issuing bonds, or, in the case of countries - creating money as explained elsewhere.

#### Sovereign debt

Treasury bonds are issued by national governments to borrow money, they return the principal with a very small interest.

### Defaults

Sovereign debt is generally considered to be very secure - as the government can repay debt under normal circumstances by printing new money.

But in some cases, the country is so indebted that printing money will lead to currency devaluation/ inflation with very bad socio-economic consequences. So, sometimes countries default on their commitment to pay back debtors.

#### Default Consequences

When a government defaults on its debts, it can only acquire loans under much harsher, tougher conditions.

#### Rescue

Troubled governments, not wanting to default - or wanting to default gracefully, are often rescued by friendly countries/ organizations like IMF and EU lending money, under conditions which discourage future budget deficits - such as raising interest rates on future government bonds, and other long-term solutions mentioned earlier

## Corruption, inefficiency

Public servants and those who otherwise depend on public funding fall into unethical practices like accepting bribes, lying, delay and coercion because their seniors compel them to do so - either explicitly or unwittingly as a result of the unrealistic or wrong expectations, or because of a desire for personal profit, or for job security.

### Bad expectations

For example, during the Chinese famine, officials presented Mao with fake fields and yields during his inspections. NYPD cops, whose anti-crime activity was being tracked using statistics, registered fewer cases, and were coerced into unnecessary pat-downs, tickets and arrests.

## Law enforcement

Considered in the society survey.

## Health care

Quality of health care varies widely amongst nations, and within nations.

### Universal health care

Universal Health Care in many countries is free or low cost.

#### Quality

The quality in many countries is good - In France there are even house-calls. In other countries beset with inefficient executive branches, like India, public health care is often low quality - though even there, there are islands of high quality.

#### Delays, overuse

Free health care is often overused, leading to resource scarcity given that a limited amount of money is alloted for health care. This can lead to long delays in access to health care procedures or specialists (dentists, MRI scans) - in 2010, this was a problem for UK’s NHS and Canada’s health service.

### Insurance based care

#### Systemic Inefficiency

##### Useless treatments

Insurance is a lousy way to pay, as it separates the consumer from the cost. Also, it results in care providers being paid per-procedure, rather than a salary. This encourages wasteful, useless treatments. 1/3 of the treatment provided in USA is wasteful.

The wrong belief among patients that more care implies lower sickness, cognitive defects in doctors who don’t rely on research and the fear of law-suits also lead to these useless treatments - but these are not specific to the insurance-system.

##### Administrative overhead

Claims processing tends to be a complicated procedure, with codes for diseases etc.., this results in a big portion of medical expenses being spent on paper-pushing.

Also, there is the overhead of negotiating with drug companies and health-care providers.

##### Partial interest in reducing cost

If health-care gets too cheap, less money flows through the insurance company as premiums, and there may be fewer customers. Also, insurance companies want to make a profit - so, people necessarily spend more than in the case of government health services.

##### Uninsured people

These are turned away - In USA, they are often dropped to homeless person shelters disoriented due to inability to pay or lack of insurance.

However, countries like USA offers Medicare insurance to the needy; but this is not automatic.

Low cost clinics like Rediclinic and minute-clinic are cropping up in USA to serve patients with common non-chronic illnesses.

#### USA

##### Comparison with other countries

This system is followed in USA, with unsatisfactory results. USA spends more money per capita on health-care than most countries in the world.

Yet, Infant mortality and life expectancy are worse than many other nations, including Cuba, Canada, France and UK. A documentary called Sicko has more criticism.

##### Employer choice

Employers are encouraged to provide health-insurance for employees, because they get a tax-break. So, patients are further removed from the payment service.

##### Forecast

This system is held in place by conservative politicians and by lobbying by drug and insurance companies; but even they are now (2011) realizing that unless they change slightly to keep everyone reasonably happy, a health-care revolution will replace them - health care costs are raising at alarming levels, and this is having a huge effect on slowing down the economy and reducing the quality of life of people.

Other options for health care, which are customer driven rather than employer driven, are cropping up.

## Education

### Schools

Most countries provide free universal compulsory primary education for children. Quality varies.

### Tuition

Access to prestigious universities/ schools may be limited, so there is often a competitive exam; for which there often exists special tuition/ cram schools.

### Higher education

In some countries (like Scandinavia, France), government heavily subsidizes higher education; while in others students must mostly rely on other sources, and accrue huge debts.

## Business attraction

### Luring away businesses

More businesses mean more tax money, and prosperity of the nation. So, territories (cities, states or countries) try to lure businesses from each other - they usually have special agencies called ’Economic development agencies’ which do this.

They sometimes offer tax-breaks in the initial years to attract businesses. They also try to achieve concentration of talent by offering pre-setup infrastructure and by setting up special economic zones where companies will get tax benefits.

### Entrepreneurship

#### Effect of taxes

Entrepreneurship rates are high in the socialist countries of Scandinavia -despite high taxes. This could be due to the fact that the government, with its excellent services, removes the financial risk associated with failure.

# Business regulation

Businesses, left to themselves, often operate to increase their own profit at the expense of the environment and the general economy.

Regulation about working conditions are described in another chapter.

## Competition promotion

Governments then try to ensure that no company gets a monopoly on any market, as monopoly reduces progress and keeps the prices up.

### Illegal activities

#### Disadvantaging competition

Microsoft, in the 1990’s, bundling the internet explorer browser with its operating system, disadvantaged rival browsers and gained monopoly.

#### Cartel formation

Treating customers as the enemy, and competitors as partners, companies collude and resolve not to compete with each other by amicably dividing up the market and fixing the price. This drains customer money, and decreases GDP growth.

Eg: In 1995, a handful of American, Korean and Japanese manufacturers of lysene colluded to fix the price; were exposed and were fined.

#### Interoperability prevention

Microsoft was fined by EU for not providing adequate documentation for the various protocols used by its products.

#### Mergers/ acquisition for monopoly

\[**Incomplete**\]

### Regulation

Government regulation designed to preserve and promote competition is called anti-trust/ competition law. Violations are met with severe fines in USA.

Sometimes, the government breaks up huge monopolies by breaking up the business into competing units.

## Foreign political regulation

### Boycotts

#### Economic embargos

\[**Incomplete**\]

#### Travel restrictions

\[**Incomplete**\]

## Credit rating of individuals

Good credit rating implies lower assessment of risk from lenders, renters and employers. Thence implies lower interest rates on loans.

In USA, one can check yearly free reports from Experian, TransUnion and Equifax at equally spaced times during the year.

### Growth

Have around 2 credit cards, maintain a high level of available capacity in each card. This contributes to increase in credit score.

# Critical goods

The availability of items determine the value of others. A reduction in their supply leads to various crises.

## Foreign currency

If an entity in country B wants to buy something from an entity in country A, it needs to pay in some currency used by country A: it could still have a choice among a set of currencies like $, yuan etc.

### Shortage

Sometimes there is a shortage in country A of currency accepted by country B’s entities.

#### Cause

Trade deficit is usually the cause: the country imports more than it exports. For example: due to a drop in tourism which in-turn could be due to higher oil prices.

#### Consequences

So due to the imbalance in supply and demand, foreign currency is suddenly more valuable. So, the country may be unable to import essential food items.

### Response

#### Immediate loan

Typically countries attempt to solve this problem by getting a foreign currency loan from an agency such as the IMF, which then imposes certain conditions to try to ensure that such foreign currency shortage does not re-occur.

#### Long-term solution

These conditions aim to reduce the reliance of the country on foreign goods by making people of the country collectively poorer, which is accomplished by currency devaluation or by reducing public services so as to increase individual expenditure or by wage cuts. These conditions often lead to social unrest.
