## Identify core ideas

A complex concept is just an arrangement of a few simple ideas. This is
important while making notes.

Learning involves repeated summarization.

## Succinct summarization

Record important patterns of ideas and solution strategies, with
examples/ counter-examples and important results. View surveys as
embedding the graph of ideas in two dimensions. The idea is to embed a
network of ideas on a sheet.

Capture the most central ideas; ideas which evoke the strongest and the
most unusual reactions. Ignore the rest. Be able to summarize the
essentials of a paper in a few paragraphs/ sentences. This is useful as
a mnemonic, as a useful device while re-reading the details, and as a
block to be used in reasoning.

## Vividness

In the surveys, note important and surpising things, which evoke a
reaction other than the usual; make things vivid. Consider making them
colorful.

Ignore and skip unimportant information.

For closeness to the subject, it is important to have favorite examples.
