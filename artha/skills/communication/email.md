## Email protocols

In sending keep-alive messages, try to mail individually.

While sending messages which might offend the other person, be careful
and use tact.

### Addressing others

In America, suppose that you are writing to X. The letter might begin
with the string ’X,’ unlike in other countries where one begins with the
string ’Dear X,’ or ’Hi X,’.

This is used to indicate a professional attitude stripped of compassion/
friendliness. It is used to focus the conversation on work and challenge
the recipient into performing his role, with an ongoing appraisal being
the incentive.

By itself, this form of addressing should not be assumed to be a sign of
excessive rudeness, but as a sign of deliberate distance, used to make
reasonable demands.

### Awaiting Response

If someone does not respond to an email in 48 hours, bug them.
