## Introduction to my mostly unoriginal terse notes

- The worlds of scientific ideas are distinct from the directly experienced world of sensations. They can be accessed only by the intellect (aka the questioning mind).
- These are my personal maps to those worlds. These were written for my own edification. Many are very incomplete and incorrect.
- They were mostly written and updated when I was trying my hand at academic research. Now, I only get to them very rarely.
- I [love](http://vishvas-vasuki.appspot.com/miscInfo/contactDetails.htm) comments and corrections.
